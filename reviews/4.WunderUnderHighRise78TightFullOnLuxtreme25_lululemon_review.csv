My only complaint is that I like my leggings really high, and since the luxtreme is so compressive these tend to not stay as high on my waist as when I first pull them on. They're the same rise as the aligns (and the rise on the aligns is perfect so I know it's the fabric that's causing the difference), for example, but because this fabric is designed to suck you in it wants to stay compressed and therefore not stay high on my waist when I pull them up. To be clear, they aren't slipping down in the crotch! They just become more of a low high rise after I move around in them.

Sadly, I am less than impressed. Followed sizing guide to start, but also went by recommendations by friends and Lululemon staff to size up in the Wunder Unders. Although they felt good on, it was immediately apparent that there was no way the waistband would stay up during a workout. At this point, I wasn't sure if I needed to size up even further since I'm new to Lululemon, but the size up was definitely too large. Sizing down to my normal pant size seemed to give a good fit, but unfortunately once I actually wore them, the waistband also rolled down with normal everyday activity.

First off I told her what I was using my leggings for (hot yoga) so she suggested the align pants. She also told me that if I wanted to try on the wunder unders I should go a size up but that the aligns were best for hot yoga. I loved the aligns so I bought them and wore them to hot yoga and they were drenched by the end of class. I feel like I ruined them from all the mositure so I was very dissapointed. I went back to by two pairs of the wunder unders and went a size up as suggested because my true size was snug when trying on. They are great for hot yoga but they stretched out so much after washing them. I've only had them for about two weeks and I now have 3 pairs that I cannot wear.

Let me tell you, the waistband stretches out after 2-3 weeks. I can't really explain why or how, but it just refuses to lay flat against your stomach, which leads to you constantly pulling the band up. The waistband just has this gaping in the front the way you would with jeans that don't fit in the waist. Nothing fixes it because even after washing them, the stretched out gaping remains. I wash all my Lululemon gear by hand in cold water because the price is just too much for me not to baby these, so I know it's not my care. Two stars because everything else about these leggings is perfect (they haven't pill so far), the fabric is light but hugging, but the waistband which according to Lululemon should do this: ""waistband lies flat against your skin"" is not the case.

Bought them in Oak Brook about 6 months ago. I never put my pants in the dryer; I always hang up everything to dry. These pants have not held up at all. They are my correct size 6, although they are baggy after about a few wearings. The most disturbing thing is that they have pilled up between the legs. They make these pants look old & worn.

I took them back to the store to get it stitched up but the girl said that the hole couldn't be repaired since it was so big.... So now I have these really expensive, ripped, useless leggings.

As I've said I have several other pairs, so it's not like I was wearing these daily or doing extraneous activities in them, they were more for everyday living rather than working out.

Ever since then the pilling has gotten out of control on the back and ankle areas, which makes no sense because I wasn't wearing any material that would cause pilling.

After checking other reviews that explained the same issues, I'm thinking that either 1. my pants were wrongly marked as Luon on the tag or 2. the store employee accidentally grabbed the wrong fabric for me.

I get workout pants don't always stay perfectly where you want them but i seriously have never experience anything like this.
my solution? i washed them, admitted defeat and labeled them as my $98.00 ""chilling"" pants. but then I went out to grab coffee over the weekend in them and it was equally uncomfortable, literally sagging between upper thigh and gap and let's be real ... no one wears tights hoping for that boyfriend fit.

I have worn these leggings four or five times in the past month and they've held up well until I was in a yoga class yesterday. I got the through the entire class, but afterwards a fellow yogi sheepishly pointed out the two inch tear on the rear of my leggings. Clearly the pants did not hold up as promised in the description.

I will gladly pay the price to get great quality and service which is why I was very much looking forward to getting a new pair of lulus after having (finally) lost the baby weight from my first. The girls were super nice and somewhat helpful as I was deciding on the style of pants I would get. These pants fit like a dream! I was in love from the moment I tried them on. They hugged in all the right places, made my booty look amazing, and were just right as far as fit. I wore them around the house MAYBE 2-3 times and they slowly began to get more and more loose to where I was constantly pulling them up and they bunched up behind my knees no matter how far I pulled them down at the ankles or up at the waist. I figured like most places that practice good customer service they would be understanding (I read all the reviews after and seems like I'm not alone) and help me to exchange for a better size. I finally decided the 2 was the way to go and the girl had, again, been super helpful while I was trying on other sizes/styles even went as far to say that she had encountered the very same problem so I thought I was going to be in and out leaving even more satisfied then the first time. As I go to ask her what the next step is she plainly tells me that since the tag was not physically attached to the pants there wasn't anything she could do. I had the tag, the receipt and the pants in hand. Literally she did not even try to make it better in any way. I said I would pay for great quality and service any day but I'm not going to pay another $100 dollars for ANOTHER pair of the same pants in a smaller size and let the other size I guess just sit in my closet. How ridiculous...C'mon Lululemon if you want to keep your fan base and loyal customers you must start with practicing good customer service. Having worked in the field of retail for many years and also experiencing it on the other side as a customer...if you want people to come back and become regular customers or even the every now and then customer...it always matters how well you decide to treat the customer and how you handle their issues. I remember from my retail days- the customer is always right!

I was excited about these legging and the first day I wore these Wunder Under Hi-Rise in the Luxtreme and Luon materials, as I initially stated, they rolled down around the waist (which defeats the purpose of high-rise/high waist). I was only grocery shopping and walking around Whole Foods and kept having to unroll and pull up the waistband (I know I wore the right size because I had a snug/tight fight around the rear & legs).
For anyone who doesn't have a flat stomach and has subtle post pregnancy pouch/Diastasis Recti, these will not hold you in & will roll down. I had better luck with the Fast & Free 7/8 Tight II, Nulux 25"", which has a stretch interior drawcord string at the top of the high rise waist band (which actually holds you in!).
I also own Victoria Secret tights/leggings in their VS Knockout High Rise (similar to Wunder Under Luon) and the VS have the drawstrings as well and I've had no issues with them (even though I am 5'3""). So if any sales assoc/educator claims ""it's because you're petite/short"" is bologna.
For those who have issues having their lululemon high rise tights roll down, there needs to be an improvement/upgrade on these Wunder Under tights.

I drove 40 mins to my nearest Lulu store to try on the 7/8 length in the print summer haze multi ( I can wear 6, 8, or 10 in lulu).
They fit great. I also asked the associate if she liked this particular legging and she said, ""she loved them and they're great in the gym.""
Whenever I purchase a pair of leggings I always ask the sales rep if she's aware of any positive of negative issues with the leggings. Mainly, I'm concerned about pilling, and I have always been lucky enough to be pointed in the right direction if a particular pair was not going to work out.
First time wearing the leggings:
Everything was perfect until....... I went to the gym.
First, I noticed that they didn't stay in place. I was constantly pulling them up. Then as soon as I got off the stair master a woman came over to let me know she could see my underwear through my pants. I was so embarrassed that I ran over to the restroom and she was correct.
When purchasing these high rise legging I had the idea of wearing them sports bras or cropped tops, and now I only feel comfortable wearing them with a long top covering my butt and something tied around my waist. This is a complete disappointment and makes my purchase a waste of money.
I am a long time buyer of Lululemon and pay the $100 price on leggings, so I can avoid things like this.

She then insinuated that I wouldn't fit in them saying that these are very tight and an xs, so I should go up a size. So I purchased a size 6 and guess what? 10 seconds into sprinting on the treadmill these pants were sliding down.

I LOVE the length -- I'm 5'9"" and I find the 7/8 pants to be the perfect length. I haven't had any problems with the pants not staying up and I personally really like the high-waisted waistband. I think the waistband pocket is pretty useless though and never use it, but if I were to use it there would be an unsightly and unflattering bulge.
To address the piling concerns: I purchased my pair in mid-January 2017 and have washed them (by hand, cold water and laid flat to dry) a few times now and have noticed no issues with piling. My legs do not rub together when walking/exercising so that helps to prevent any piling, but I do NOT baby these leggings during workouts. I use them for yoga, lounging, strength workouts and boxing and have had no issues. I see a little wear on them at this point, but they still look almost new and I know I can get at least another 6 months of use before they look ""old"". However, I purchased a pair of these last summer and they did not fare as well, though I was not careful about washing those by hand. Seriously DO NOT dry these in the dryer AT ALL. They will stretch and pill.",4 out of 5,CKRIT,"BERKELEY, CA, USA",SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,ATHLETIC,,length,sheer,2017-03-03,6,0,{}

This was my first Wunder Under purchase & first purchase of Lulu crops or pants that did NOT have a drawstring at the waist, since I mainly have worn lulu for Crossfit, pants that roll down or fall down are NOT an option (love my Top Speeds crops, Inspires, & Pace Rivals). I was planning to wear these for casual wear, which was attending a basketball tournament and have mercy, these kept rolling down the entire time. Would love to exchange for a better fitting pair but not sure what my recourse is since I've worn them once. I wanted a solid black pair of crops or 7/8 pants with NO mesh or extra seams & the Wonder Under seemed to fit the bill - plain & simple - but I'm having a hard time finding the solution.

I am way too short for the regular pants (I'm only 5'5"") and the crops are just not my favorite length (I feel like I look even shorter in them). I put these in my cart and just left them for a while contemplating. I love the ""ankle"" length (where you have about 2 inches of ankle showing) so I decided to just go for it. I got them yesterday, so I can't comment on the pilling (although I don't see this fabric pilling, but I guess I will find out) but I do love the length, the feel of the fabric, the high waist. My suggestions would be to make the ankle hem a tiny bit skinnier (they are a bit loose around the hem but not near as bad as the High Times) and I would love to see the logo put back on the calf like they used to have it.
