These pants look nice for the first wear (I originally chose them because the pattern is really cool) but after only two washes per the instructions and drying flat there's already a significant amount of pilling on the pants. I think it's just the 4 way stretch material that isn't as good as the quality material used in the Align pants. I can deal with the pilling, but they're also super sheer when in a yoga class (yikes) so you definitely need to wear a longer shirt. Stick to align if you still buy lulu, all of the newer materials like 4 way stretch are not good quality, and thus not worth the price tag",1 out of 5,MK77,"TORONTO, ON, CANADA",RUNNER,I KEEP MY AGE ON THE D.L.,SLIM,second skin,design,material quality,2019-01-18,1,0,"{'LL_response_content': 'Dear MK77,\n\nThank you for taking the time to review the Reveal Tight *Lattice Paisley 28"".

I am an avid Lulu shopper, and own several tights; I have always been very pleased with the quality and coverage of the materials used, but these are different. Despite being recommended for yoga, the bum goes VERY sheer when you bend over, and even the thighs are a little sheer with a little stretch. I would definitely NOT be doing any downward dog poses in these!
I contemplated returning them, but did decide to keep them because i am in love with the leg patterns, however I feel like i have to wear a longer shirt with them to cover my bum. For $128, I expected a much better quality of material.
I would love to see this type of pattern (reveal detail) in the Wunder Under or Align material!!!
