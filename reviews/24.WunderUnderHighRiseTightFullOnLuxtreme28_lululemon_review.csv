However, I've had two pairs of these pants in black and midnight navy for about six months now, and after casual wear (no running or high intensity workouts) they've both stretched out to the point where I'm constantly having to pull them up.

However, there is still a little sweating that inevitably happens in areas that are not particularly flattering. These pants showed ALL of my sweat. I don't know if it's particular to the sage color (I imagine black would be much less evident) or the material. But it was definitely a bit embarrassing, although in a self-deprecating manner pretty funny, and had I known that was going to happen I would have chosen to wear different pants that show sweat a bit more subtly .

They felt great....I love the compression....and they looked great (I love that they aren't too thick, but also are not see-through at all). The problem was when I tried to work out in them (or honestly, just move around at all in them). They just won't stay up. I am constantly grabbing the waistband and pulling them up. It's not that they stretch out....the waistband just doesn't hold them up. AND.....if I bend over at all (ie - yoga, pilates, cross-training, etc) the waistband rolls, which is very uncomfortable. I didn't realize this was a problem across the board for what looks like everyone who bought them. I thought it was just my body. I have never been able to justify the price of Lulu pants for me, but was going to treat my daughters each to a pair for their birthdays. After this experience that won't be happening. I wear them often so my daughter can see me in them, but I have to remain conscious of not pulling them up constantly in front of her because I don't want her to know.

After informing her that the pilling began before I washed them she told me I could swap them for a new pair the next time I was at a store.
I did this and ended up purchasing these Wonder Under leggings instead. The sales rep that sold these to me said that they were much more durable than the align II leggings. This much is true, I have very minimal pilling with these (even though I think there should be no pilling if you pay so much $$ on them) however, my main complaint with these is that they fall down like crazy! The last thing you want to do while working out is have to tug on your pants. Very annoying! They get stretched out very quickly while wearing them.

All in all, these might be OK pants if I went a size smaller. But what the heck is up with lulu's quality?? I thought this was a high end brand, but the leggings wash up like bargain bin leggings.

“added Lycra® fibre for stretch and shape retention” no problem with stretching out, pilling or loose seams. Looks great after one month.

Well, they arrived today and as with MANY (read, all) Lulu Full-On Luxtreme tights, they use the lightest possible color lining the inside of the fabric, and on these it's white. WHITE!! Why does Lululemon insist on doing this? 1. it makes it fade over parts of your body where they're might me more stretch, hips, thighs, butt, etc.
2. it makes it more see-through.
These are too busy to be see through and I was sure to try them on with bright striped underwear to test them out. But, because I have big thighs they fade and stretch and the pattern just doesn't look good. Oddly it doesn't do this over my butt and I have a sizable one. For ref, 34"" waist 45.5"" hips and I usually wear 8 or 10 in this particular fabric, but on these the waist was too big and even just looking in different mirrors, I had to keep pulling them up. They are going back. Also, the rise is like the photo, it's really not that high, at least not in the front.

The first couple of wears, they felt great. But soon after, the waist on both constantly slid down because the fabric stretched out while wearing them, so I'm always pulling them up. So I decided to order the starlight pattern in a smaller size, thinking this will solve the issue. I just wore them today for the first time during my workout, and couldn't wait to rip them off! Do not buy them in a smaller size because this will not solve the issue. It's even worse, not only were they sliding down, but they were rolling down as well. It was so uncomfortable. After reading many of the reviews, I finally realized that this happens with the Luxtreme fabric. And I now know, after three pairs, how much I hate Luxtreme leggings and will sadly never order them again. Sure, they feel soft but they won't stay put on my waist. Where's the compression?

Now, almost 2 years later, I am 5 1/2 months pregnant with baby #3 and am still wearing this same pair of pants regularly! How in the world can something fit so perfectly over a range of 40+ pounds, and pregnant or not pregnant?! They feel super supportive, they show off my curves in the most flattering way, and they have held up nearly perfectly despite my constant use. I own pants from Nike and Under Armour and nothing I've tried compare to these. I jog, lift weights, do HIIT, you name it, and they have never slid down or moved, even at my lowest weight. Incredible, heaven-sent pants that make my confidence sore at any size. I will definitely purchase again and again.

I spent all of my birthday money the week of spring break in Mid-April on a pair of these, and was so super excited about my 1st purchase. I went with basic and black, and did enjoy the look of the high rise, however during any kind of workouts including yoga, they ride down significantly. The fit is right in terms of size, but the hi rise waist does not seem to stay in place with the slightest of movement. After 1 month and approximately 3 cold washes, I noticed not only did the fade, but also began to have piling like crazy, which I'm now seeing many people experienced. I'm now on month 2, and I have never dried these pants, only air-dryed, and still the quality has gone downhill fast. It's super disappointed when you can spend $25-30 on a pair from TJ Maxx or Marshalls and they hold up better than a pair for $98! My family has even said ""where are those expensive leggings we financed???"" I'm afraid to wear them to their house, because all I did was go on and on about how great they were before I bought them, and they thought the price was outrageous.

I've only recently started buying lulu pants, I have a lot of bras and one day I saw a print in the Wunder Under Full on Luxtreme in an e-mail and had to go check it out.

The only con is they do start to stretch out if I wear them too often / for a full day of non athletic activities. I sometimes wonder if I should have sized down. Also they sometimes fall down when I'm running, but seem to stay/secure to my body once I start sweating a little / my body temp rises.

So here's my amended review.
I purchased these pants on March 14, 2017. Initially I liked them although 20 minutes or so into my workout they would bag at the knees and crotch (I tried a size down and they were sheer, so I stuck to my regular size). I liked the pattern, so I stuck with them even though I always reach for my tight stuff and fast & frees over them.
I went to put them on and noticed two small snags near the crotch, one of which was actually a pin-sized hole. If I could upload a photo I would, but it is obvious from the in-tact rip tag the still looks brand new and unwashed that I haven't worn these more than a few times. I brought them, my receipt and the cardboard hang tag into the store to exchange them given that these are clearly defective. However, the associate refused stating that the only thing they can do is have their tailor sew the hole.
If the hole was along a seam, I can understand the offered resolution. However when the hole isn't along a seam, a see fix is going to create a small bulge. Even though I am part of the old R & D and purchased these at a discount, the performance and quality of these tights is unacceptable given the price point.
My lululemon purchases and positive feedback to others has greatly diminished over the past year mainly due to quality. Generally I've had positive experiences with lululemon standing behind their gear. Unfortunately this latest incident has finally driven me away from lululemon.
By the way, the associate did say that if I found the stitching uncomfortable, they'd take them back. I surmise that Lululemon doesn't value my time in that I have to wait for these to be stitched, pick them up in store, then wear and wash them. Then, return to the the store, hope that they stand by their word. Or, was I suppose to lie in the first place and say that the stitching bothered me, and by the way, there's a hole??",1 out of 5,LOVEDOGS,SAN FRANCISCO,SWEATY GENERALIST,35-44,SLIM,,pattern and null is comfortable,quality quality poor customer exp.,2017-06-11,3,0,"{'LL_response_content': 'Hey LoveDogs,\nThanks for taking the time to share your feedback.

"Wunder Under High-Rise Tight Full-On Luxtreme 28""",https://shop.lululemon.com/p/women-pants/Wunder-Under-HR-Tight-Full-Lux/_/prod8330011?color=31382,2.9 out of 5,24,"HAAAAAATE The Hi-Rise, Fit Okay Otherwise","These pants are better than similar alternatives from other brands (specifically the under armour, which are similar material and only cost $59, but slide down just from walking and I ended up donating after wearing for a frustrating 2 months). The main body of these tights fit well and for the most part stay put. They are close to being perfect, but there are a few flaws that keep them from being as comfortable and useful as they should be.
First, the picture of the model for these Hi-Rise pants make it appear that the waist goes up to your bellybutton...maybe if you're 6' tall. But I am only 5'4"" and the waist reaches over my rib cage and to the bottom of my bra line. It looks absolutely ridiculous!!! It's even too much for the trendy ""high pants"" look where people wear high rise ""mom"" pants with a tube top (or sports bra). There is very little skin showing between my pants and my bra (I hate that look anyway but thought maybe that's why they made these?).
The only benefit of a waist this high is during winter when it adds an extra layer of warmth over your body. The waist is tight around my rib cage, but if I do certain workouts, the waist starts to slip down over the narrower part of my waist, at which point it makes wrinkly bunched up rolls under my shirt where I would otherwise have a completely flat and tight stomach. The high waist might be good for people who have a pudgy belly and are hoping to smooth it out, but if you are in good shape, it actually has the opposite effect.
The Luxtreme material is better than the Luon for keeping the pants from pilling, but the Luxtreme is a little less sturdy than the Luon (because they are a thinner material and they have a tighter fit). You have to put them on kind of like pantyhose, and you have to be careful not to dig your nails in too much and poke a hole in them if you have long nails.
The Luxtreme also gives less of a ""smoothing"" effect over butt dimples than the Luon. If you have a fairly nice backside, it won't make much difference, but if you have more dimples it will be more noticeable in the Luxtreme than the Luon. The Luxtreme is more comfortable in all weather because it keeps you warm and covered up in the cold, but cool in the warmer weather, whereas Luon will keep you warm all the time, and is too hot in warmer weather.
The length of these pants is a bit long for my 5 feet 4 inches, but they just bunch a small amount at the ankles and I think they look good. I tried the 7/8th pants but those just ended up looking like I was wearing pants that were too small, more like high waters. Also, I wear a size 6 in wunder unders and I am 120 pounds, but have worn them when I was only 110 pounds also, and they fit perfectly for both weights (I am for the most part the same size at both weights, I just have more muscle at the higher weight so that might be why). Size 4 fits, but is just small enough that it creates a bit of a squeezed sausage look in my butt and thighs, but in the 6 I look toned and strong. I wear a 4 in their shorts though, so I guess the size difference is my thighs. Hope that helps someone figure out their size.
Lastly, because the Luxtreme is a more sleek material than Luon, they will eventually slide down a bit when doing more intense workouts, where Luon never does that. I have tested these in several situations before reviewing and have done an hour cycling class, a body pump (weight lifting) class, and gone for a 3 mile, a 5 mile and an 8 mile run in them as well as spent a whole day running errands. They stay put for the cycling, body pump and 3 mile run, but once you get to the longer runs, they do start to slide a little bit, and when the run is over (or during the run), you will find yourself cinching them back up because they are falling in the crotch area a bit. I have a well defined backside, which is better for these pants because your butt will hold up the pants better than if you have a smaller, flatter behind where there's nothing to hold the pants in place over your waist. I have 2 pairs of wunder unders in Luon and they never ever slip or slide, even on a 10 mile run.
All that being said, I would recommend the Luxtreme over the Luon because they will look new longer, and for me, I want these to last several years because of how expensive they are. I don't want to replace my $100 pants every year. But keep in mind that you have to be more careful with them so you don't get holes in them. I have 17 pairs of Lulu pants (5 wunder under and 12 other) and 5 pairs of shorts that I have purchased over the last 10 years. The quality of the pants has gone down over the years, as my 10 year old pants (while not stylish anymore) have held up better and look newer than my 2 year old pants (that really need to be thrown out because I have to take a sweater de-baller to them almost every time I wear them and they are faded and look old and worn out). I also have these tights in the ""low rise,"" which aren't much better, since the waist on those looks like the picture for the ""hi-rise"" (the waist goes up to the belly button). My 10 year old low rise Lulus hit right at the hip bone and are true low rise.

These are great for the gym and for anything else. I have even been wearing them as pants (shame on me-ha!) I have a decent butt already and they make it look amazing. They hide an cellulite bumps on my legs. My tummy is already pretty flat and it makes it look even better.
