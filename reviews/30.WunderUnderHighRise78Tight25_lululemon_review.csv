These were soft in the slightest, not that all the lulu's I own are soft rather than comfortable on the skin, these itched my legs so bad. Plus, I got them in my usual size, an 8, and the white dots look so stretched out and makes the pants not look right. I own an 8 in LITERALLY every pair of lulu's I own and have never had this problem-and no it is not thanks to recent weight gain as I got a pair of aligns around the same time and they fit beautifully. They were itchy, hard to get up my legs and kept falling throughout the day all the while giving me the camel-toe look.
