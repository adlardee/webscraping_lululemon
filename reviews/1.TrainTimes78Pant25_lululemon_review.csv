Long time lulu fan here since 2002 so I've tried and own a lot. I really wanted something in this dusty dawn color and when I turned around and blinked the high waisted wunder unders sold out so I saw these and purchased them in dusty dawn and white. I'm not quite sure where the whole pilling thing is coming from other reviewers but I've never had pilling on anything lulu that was made of luxtreme. Luon well, that's another story but that is the nature of the beast of that fabric no matter what brand. Alo Yoga I'm talking to you. What may pill is the threading but not the fabric and that has happened very rarely. Pretty much only during the whole sheer rear debacle many years ago. I luckily haven't seen a problem since. With that said these appealed to me because at 5' tall I've grown to accept that leggings were never made with us short legged gals in mind. The petite people that can get away with it are size 0 and that I am not. I'm a size 6 in lululemon and everything with long sleeves and full length leggings tend to be too long. These were actually the perfect length and went straight to my ankles. No bunching. I have killer massive calves so they actually fit pretty nice. No open spaces really. I love where these fit on my waist too. High waisted and they hold my stomach in. I like the pocket in the back waist because with a little manipulating I can fit my iphone 7plus in. I like the mesh detail but truth be told I don't LOVE it. I kinda got sick of the whole mesh thing last year. Over all these are freaking amazing. I have to disagree with the negative reviews. I've worn and washed these and I'm lazy people I don't hang dry my stuff. I wash in cold inside out and low air dry in my dryer and they show no wear and tear. I was worried about ordering my true to size in these which is a 6 because the 6 in the speed crop made of the same material is a sausage tight fit. On a good note they hold all of me in on a bad note despite how tight those are I find myself constantly pulling them up. I didn't have that problem with these. Give them a try people.
