I bought these in a size 6 and a size 8. They both “fit”, but I thought I would be more comfortable in the waist with the size 8. I’ve washed and worn these a few times now. No pilling or loose seams! I do wish I had kept the size 6 in retrospect. Although the waist doesn’t fall down when I ride, I feel like the pants have loosened up in the knee area. Overall, a great buy!",5 out of 5,33JOZWI,DELAWARE,CYCLIST,25-34,ATHLETIC,,material,loose in the knees,2019-02-05,0,0,{}

(I mean, tap backs are never easy but they felt way better in these pants!)",I'm pretty sure I've ever written a review before in my life but I felt like I needed to tell people how much I love these pants. Went from Pure Barre to SoulCycle and these pants were perfect. The stitched seams are flattering and thoughtfully placed to not get in the way of your movements. *HIGHLY RECOMMEND* making the investment!,5 out of 5,KSOY,"SEATTLE, WA",SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,ATHLETIC,,,,2019-02-04,0,0,{}
