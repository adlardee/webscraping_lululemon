For reference, I am 5'5"" and 130lbs. I typically purchase my WU's in size 6, my Aligns in size 4, and all tops in size 8.
To start off, I hate Luxtreme. I hate spandex. They do not compliment mostly anyone, and they create the worst cameltoes. That is why I purchase Luon fabric, because the cotton blend they make does not lose give after a period of time (depending on how good it's made). Each luxtreme item I've eventually had to adjust and pull up every 5 minutes by simply walking. Each Luon I rarely have to. Aligns, we already know they're perfect aside from the annoying fragility.
So my review for these leggings would be 3.5/5. I cannot stand that Lululemon makes changes to their fabric without any sort of disclosure to their customers. This is advertised as Full-On Luon, but it absolutely not. It doesn't feel like ANY WU pant I have ever owned. It's not soft, it's rough - it's not matte, it's sheer - it doesnt morph, it squeezes. It's the kind where you can't stretch it, if you pull it up - bam, camel toe.
This isn't to say it's a BAD thing. I'm obsessed with the slate gray to white ombre pattern. I think they're very complimenting in a way where they squeeze you in more than usual. I wear these on my heavy squatting days because they offer compression - but my beef with that is: it isn't advertised to it's customers who are expecting a regular Luon cottony- WU pant and instead get a firm, lack of stretchiness, rough pair.",4 out of 5,STEPHLIKESLULULEMON,"WASHINGTON, USA",SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,ATHLETIC,tight,pattern,tight,2019-01-05,7,0,{}

I ordered my usual size 4, and they did not disappoint: I got the snug fit I was after, requiring even less tugging than usual, and the print is great.

The waist band also comes up higher than all the other HR Wunder Unders, Aligns, etc... which makes them a bit uncomfortable esp since they fit so much smaller than all the other lulu tights. The waist band also folds/rolls down since they come up so high and cut into the waist so painfully...
