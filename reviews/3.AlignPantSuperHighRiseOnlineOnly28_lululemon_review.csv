I have older pairs of aligns that have a nulu fabric that is 76% nylon and 24% spandex and they resisted pilling much better than this more recent nulu fabric does.

I have purchased the Wunder Under leggings previously, but this was my first time purchasing the Align Pant. I was very satisfied with the leggings because of the extremely soft fabric, which felt very lightweight on my skin. While wearing the leggings, it felt like I wasn’t even wearing anything because of how thin and comfortable the material was. Not only are they super comfortable and lightweight, but they also fit my body perfectly. I am a little under 5’6” and I got the 25” leggings in a size 4, and they were the perfect length. The only thing that I noticed about these leggings is that they started to pill in the butt area after a few wears. They also became less soft after a few washes, so I try not to wash them very often.

I LOVE THESE TIGHTS! They are buttery soft and the higher rise waistband goes up and over my really high belly button, without making my crotch look long. I purchased the Melanite color, which is a welcome change from basic black while still being just as versatile. That said, I'll be buying the black pair as well.
These are the perfect tights for yoga. The extended gusset provides freedom of movement, without any seams digging in. I never worry about these tights being see through in a forward fold or straddle.
Please keep in mind when purchasing these tights that they are specifically a YOGA tight (although they are great to hang out it as well).

I was very hungover. I grabbed 6 pairs of leggings and went to the dressing room. When I was in the dressing room I was overheating and trying not to throw up.

Head was pounding, room was spinning but my butt looked amazing. Even though I was feeling awful I felt like I could do 30 hours of yoga. Everyone says they are amazing and let me tell you the hype is real. So I leave the dressing room knowing that I'm about to make a horrible decision financially, but an amazing decision for my overall well being. I buy 3 pairs of leggings, yep that's right, the most hungover decision of all time? maybe. I get home still feeling awful I take a shower, after the shower I still felt awful (which is always my cure), but then I put on the leggings... I swear I felt so much better. The world wasn't spinning, my head wasn't pounding, and for the first time in my life my flat butt looked like a hill instead of a valley! I LOVE THEM. I am very GRATEFUL that hungover me made a ""bad"" decision, because it turned out to be one of the best decisions I have ever made.

I was in love as soon as I tried them on because the fabric is buttery soft & smooth yet it offers great coverage. I was just going to place an order for a secon pair of align leggings however I hesitated because I noticed my original pair has begun to pill :( I only wore & washed the leggings a couple of times and followed the care instructions carefully, I made sure to take care of these since they are pricey. Wish I would’ve read the reviews before I invested in a pair that now I can only wear as pajamas due to the amount of pill.",2 out of 5,LCYLU00,"LOS ANGELES, CA, USA",YOGI,35-44,ATHLETIC,,fabric retains shape,fabric pills,2018-11-15,6,0,"{'LL_response_content': ""Hey Lcyluoo,\n\nThanks for reaching out and providing this feedback for us!

I'm currently 6 month pregnant and these are the pants I'm always turning to. They were one of my favorite Lulu styles but these are so easy to transition into pregnancy, the extra high rise was a no brainer and I'm so glad I got them. They are more comfortable than any other maternity leggings I've tried and I know they are going to be in my top favorites once me back heals. The only downside is that if the other aligns are any indication they will pill and that sucks. I wouldn't recommend them for high intensity workouts.",4 out of 5,ADELA,"CHICAGO, IL, USA",YOGI,25-34,CURVY,,softness,pilling,2018-11-06,18,3,{}

I went and spent $100 expecting these to last but all I could feel is the pilling when I walk even with my new ones. I wash them correctly but still Pilling! I have been avoiding wearing them because they sometimes are uncomfortable to walk in due to it happening in the upper inner thigh area. I honestly love these because they are so soft and comfortable when you first get them but they do not last past 3-4 wears. I really hope that the company steps it up because this is nonsense to spend so much on such low and poor longevity.,3 out of 5,ANGIELOV395,MICHIGAN,,18-24,CURVY,,soft and comfortable,pilling and not long lasting,2018-11-04,22,4,"{'LL_response_content': 'Dear AngieLov395,\n\nThank you for taking the time to review the Align Pant Super Hi-Rise 28"".
