I love how they fit. The super high-waist is amazing. It really stops them from rolling down like most other leggings I have, and like all lulu's they make your butt look amazing. However, I don't like the fabric. It's still totally squat proof but with just one wear I've found that they're already starting to pile. I have many other pairs of lulu's that I've worn way more times than once that still don't pile. Also, every piece of hair sticks to them... and when you've got a black dog with pink pants, you can tell lol.

Initially, I was really excited and scared at the same time to buy them (since they are supposed to be good quality, but so expensive). From the look of them online, they seemed like they would be the perfect fit for me (high rise, luon, black). However, I ordered a size up because I find that their Luon fabric is see-through in my size. After working up the nerve to buy them, I was pretty disappointed. I wanted to love these leggings, since they had the high waist that I like and were made of Luon, my favourite fabric from this brand (keep in mind I also spent about 2 hours in the store trying on different makes and fabrics to figure out which one I liked best). After maybe 3 wears, the leggings began to pill, stretched out and it almost feels as though the material thinned out because they don't hold me in as well and leave me to constantly having to pull them up. The stretching could be due to the fact of me buying the larger size, but that is what was recommended to me. I am now really sad that I have these $100 leggings sitting in my room that don't fit right.

Sadly a few months after I started wearing it (once or twice a week) I noticed a small hole a few inches below the crotch area between my thighs. The hole has not completely torn down but I am disappointed because I expected these tights to not wear down quickly.

I bought a pair, but I will be returning them.
First of all, let me just say how much rage I have for the fact that the length has changed from 31"" to 28"". The new length looks so so stupid on me. They're about 1"" too short so they look like they shrunk in the wash. I'm not even THAT tall (5'8""), but guess it was more important for lulu to save on all that free hemming, than to cater to their taller clientele. It would have been nice if they offered regular, short and tall options instead of changing the length altogether.
The second qualm I have is that THESE. ARE. SEE. THROUGH. I didn't notice in the change room, but the light was different at home and you can see everything. I feel sick to my stomach that I spent over $100 on pants that are see through. I've loved lulu for years, and it would be nice to be able to replace some of my older stuff with new, but the quality isn't there anymore, and I'm a bit at a loss for what to do. I want new Wunder Unders. But I'm not paying that much for a lousy product.",1 out of 5,GINGERNINJA,"WINNIPEG, MB, CANADA",SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,CURVY,,,,2017-10-18,22,5,"{'LL_response_content': 'Hi gingerninja,\nThanks for taking the time to share your feedback.
