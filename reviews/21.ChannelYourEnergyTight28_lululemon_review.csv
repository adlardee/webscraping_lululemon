Also, the pattern on the tights would be cute on with someone no curves and a stick figure. It is very unflattering on women with curves (and I wear a size 4).
I love lululemon bottoms and think they are worth the money when I find a Luxetreme Capri/bottom that compliments curvy body types and doesn’t have mesh all over the legs.
