They are so light that it feels like you're running naked - in the best way. I ran my first SeaWheeze Half Marathon in these puppies last September and they were great.
*However, after a year of consistent wear (and despite washing them religiously as directed), they are now pilling at the inner seams and the stitching is coming undone in the inner thigh area. I now check the stitching in the inner thigh area every time that I put these on because I feel like its a matter of days before a hole comes to fruition. This is very sad because I am used to lululemon clothing lasting many years. So, for the high price that these leggings fetched (from my gift-givers), it feels disappointing that they will need to be replaced very soon.

Thank you for creating my permanent addiction to the fast and free tights. I have half of my running leggings drawer deducted just to the fast and free tights because they feel like second skin, very soft, have tons of pockets and flatter the legs. They are perfect for any high intensity exercises especially running.
Personal thank you for releasing a longer version in 28, I finally have pairs that go all the way to my socks and there is just a small slit of skin that I see depending on how high are my socks (I am 5’7). Now, of course, naturally, I have to rebuy all my favorite colors in this long version. I have already stocked up on black, nocturnal teal and green camo. Dark sport red is no go for me personally because it is an orangy brick color and I do not like orange; if you have sold a dark red, not dark sport red, I would probably would get it. Surprisingly, my favorite pair is now the green camo even though I am not a green camo person per se. It is so beautiful that I reach for them first.
Please, release more colors in this 28 length. Just some ideas for you: true navy, midnight navy, titanium or some other beautiful dark grey (please-please), melantine (?), black/grey camo preferably sequia camo but I will take savana camo too (please-please!), dark olive, pacific teal, black cherry, phantom, some dusty pink color such as quicksand, dark red, ... should I continue or you have gotten a hint, wink-wink?",5 out of 5,DAYDESIRE,"WISCONSIN, USA",SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,CURVY,,,,2018-12-04,1,0,{}

Take it with a grain of salt however, because I have no other LLL leggings to compare them to that speaks for quality comparisons. My favorites for the last few years have been the Knockout tights from Victoria's Secret, but I think I may even like these better. Which I better, for double the price lol. The material is not cotton at all, so they're not a direct comparison to that pant. I am 6'0"" with a curvy build and these fit me perfectly. They are high rise with some length to spare at the bottom, so if you're shorter than me, you may have to get them hemmed. I'd say they provide more than light coverage because I feel held in quite well without feeling stuffed. They are 100% squat proof as well; I can't see anything when I bend over, even with direct light. They feel so comfortable and soft on my legs.
