I would give a 5 plus rating. Then after about 4 washes in the directions they give you they sparkly foil came off. I'm left with tights that look almost just plain black. If they weren't such a great look and great fit I would have given a 1. But they are great other then the sparkle foil came off.,3 out of 5,KAYKNUMBER9,"NEW BRUNSWICK, CANADA",YOGI,25-34,ATHLETIC,,fit,sparkle foil came off in wash,2018-11-30,41,0,"{'LL_response_content': ""Dear Kayknumber9,\n\nThanks for reaching out and providing this feedback for us.
