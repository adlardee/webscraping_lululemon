My one request would be to make a version of these that are slightly thicker so that they are warmer during the winter but when you're a hot and sweaty mess after barre, this pair is perfect.

Up until I purchased these pants, I wouldn't shop any other brand. These pants are so bad that I will now shop any brand except lulu. I tried them on in store and loved them so much that I bought 2 pairs. I exercise about 5 times a week doing weight lifting, cycling and running. I could not make these pants work for any of these exercises. I have 3 main issues with these pants.
First is how bad they stretched out. I own pairs of lulus that are 3+ years old and they still fit like they did when I purchased them. These stretched out to the point that I can no longer wear them. Every time I worked out in these all I could focus on was pulling them up and not letting them sag. It is so frustrating. Towards the end of my workouts I would be unable to pull them up because they would be stuck to my sweaty legs and waist.
Next, the waist of these pants is way too snug. When I tried them on in the store, the employee told me that the waist will fit like that until my first wear and then it will be more comfortable. This did not happen. While it did stretch a little, they are still so snug that it hurts. I got these in my normal size 2. I tried on a 4 and the waist was a better fit but the legs were too big. The employee suggest I stick with the 2 and that it would likely stretch out. Next time Ill be sure to buy pants that fit perfectly when I first try them on.
Last, the pants are coming apart at the seams even though they are fairly new and are only ever air dried after washing. This wasn't as big of a deal to me because I have taken previous pants in to get holes fixed and they were fixed free of charge and haven't fallen apart since. However, this was the icing on top of the cake to the stretching and tight waist band.
After purchasing 2 pairs of these pants and being stuck with them since they are past the return policy, I am very disappointed in lululemon. These pants were my 9th and 10th pair. As mentioned previously, I loved all my pairs and the only problem I have run into is falling apart at the seam which was fixed to perfection for free. I hope in the future that lulu creates more stretch free pants and that they stay true to size as far as waist and leg size.",1 out of 5,SAARAAHP,"PASADENA, CA",SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,PETITE,oversized,,,2018-05-21,1,0,"{'LL_response_content': ""Hey saaraahp,\n\nThank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

Also nothing makes my butt look better than these tights. And lululemon's customer service really cannot be beat. Love these tights and will continue to buy them. I highly recommend for people who do intense workouts. These are one of the only tights I can run hard in and not have to continue pulling up throughout my run.

I have not tried a solid color yet--that is only because of the sweat issue people have mentioned in reviews on the other listing of speed up tights. Sweat does show on prints, especially in the crotch (yes, the unfortunate wet your pants look), but it's somewhat subtle. I usually only wear them for running outside so I don't care, but if it was more obvious or I was at a gym I definitely would.
I'm specifically reviewing the Score Jacquard Black Luna which I just received. I like that they are not white on the inside, so there is no fade over hips and thighs, but when I did a squat test I could see my underwear, but they are not completely see through. I also purchased the Crystalline Multi (other listing of speed ups) and they are bright white on the inside which looked ridiculous over my butt and thighs, because the pockets are the darkest part of the tight as the rest is faded to almost lavender because of the stretch--more so if I squat. Sizing up wouldn't help because the waist would be too big.--Those I can't review because Lulu doesn't let you edit reviews or write new ones for the same item, so I'm including those details here.
Back to the Jacquard--they are more snug than the others I've tried, but I'm keeping them because once I squeezed myself into them they fit fine, it was just getting the tight waist up over my hips. They also seem longer than other pairs I own. I'm 5'5"" and the rise seems a little higher too, which is fine since I'll be using them for running, spin and probably bootcamp--depending how sweat shows. My only concern right now is that the Jacquard feels like it could snag or pull on the inside--as it has texture that could easily be snagged by a fingernail, the texture is different then all the other speed up tights I own and they feel a little warmer.",3 out of 5,YOGIRUNAHOLIC,NEW YORK,RUNNER,35-44,CURVY,tight,compression,most prints are bright white on the inside,2017-12-24,3,0,"{'LL_response_content': ""Hey yogirunaholic,\nThanks for taking the time to share your feedback.
