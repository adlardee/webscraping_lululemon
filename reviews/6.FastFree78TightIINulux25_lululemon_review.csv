They are too big to workout in now. I have tried drying them to get them back to size, but they just stretch back out again. After all this, the 2 appears it would be the perfect size.

I own two pairs of the pants in black. I bought them 13 months ago. I spin 6 days per week, and I wear each pair 3 times in 1 week. This means that I wash each pair 3 times per week. 13 months after, each pair must have gone through almost 170 washing cycles, and they look just like the first day. Just make sure you wash in cold, and do not tumble dry (just hang to dry).
I am 5'2 and I weight around 105 pounds. The person that helped me at the store told me to buy the size 2, but I went for a size 4. I think that maybe the reason why a lot of people are saying it is breaking is because they are buying sizes that are just too small!
I hope this pants are not discontinued, The Nulux material is perfect for sweaty biking sessions. I used to wear the Wunder Under, I was always dying from the heat. This pants are a game changers.

For reference I am 5'2"", 130lbs give or take. I ordered a size 6, and then tried a size 4. I feel like if they had made a size 5 they would have fit perfectly. The 6 had a lot of bunching fabric around the back of my knees and just under the butt cheek. They felt nice on, but the bunching made it look obvious that they just didn't fit me right. I am not crazy about the drawstring waist, however I can see how that would be helpful if you're a runner to keep them in place. Size 4 got rid of the bunching, but was just WAY too snug around the waist for me to be comfortable.
Pros of these pants are definitely the print. The Sunrise Silhouette Multi print is gorgeous and doesn't stretch out and loose it's intense colour. 100% squat-proof. Love the pockets, they're deep and useful, barely noticable. Also love the reflective dots on the leg and the Lululemon Logo on the leg. I feel like I'm the only one who misses the Lululemon logo on the leg of their leggings. Bring back the Lulu leg-logo!! Love the seamless ankle and high waist. So yeah, lots of pros, but not enough for me to keep them.
I feel like the price is too steep for these. The fabric is nice, yes, but I don't feel like they're any more significant than any of my Wunder Unders. Only real advantage are the pockets. In fact as I thought about when and how I would wear these leggings, I could tell that I wouldn't be reaching for these much. Hard to believe because they are so pretty, but just not my jam.

I loved them because I looked amazing and they felt amazing. After about 5 months there was a hole on the seam, so I went to one store and they said they couldn't do anything, but I knew that they should exchange them because it was on a seam, so I went to another location. At that location she exchanged them no problem (and gave me a smaller size because the other size was too big) and it was all good. Fast forward 5 more months and now my ""new"" ones have a hole in the back of the leg. I have no idea why this hole happened, but since it isn't on a seam I cannot exchange them. So overall they didn't really last me that long. Also even my ""new"" ones were really loose, I recommend getting a size or two down because I had to tie them up with the elastic waist band on both pairs.

I NEVER write reviews, but I feel very strongly about this particular purchase. This was my first time ever purchasing anything Lululemon because I am pretty active and I figured I should finally start investing in athletic clothing that will last me a while. I went to the store and tried on pretty much every pair of leggings and landed on these because they were so buttery soft and I do quite a bit of HIIT. Firstly, the person who helped me out recommended a size that was about 1 to 2 sizes too big upon wearing them by the second time. I went back to the store and they happily exchanged my purchase to the correct size and I was thrilled to work out in them, use them for commute, and honestly, just to hang around my apartment. The exchange happened about a month and a half or two ago, and they've already stretched out significantly (I have not lost weight). Additionally, they have started to pill between my thighs, which I get would happen with jeans or cheaper material, but my inexpensive leggings from discount stores that I've had for years haven't even done that. The fact that $16 leggings are holding up better than $128 leggings is so baffling. The reason I did give it two stars is because they make my booty look so good, the fabric is so, so, so soft and as long as they don't stretch out, they give you a really nice shape. Again, mine have stretched and not even the waistband tie can hold them up while I WALK, let alone when I'm doing burpees at the studio. Honestly, if you're going to buy these, size down about three sizes, or find another legging from Lulu that is made for the same activity.

I bought both the Pace Rival Crop and Fast & Free 7/8 Tight II. The first time I wore the leggings they were fantastic! The fit was perfect- I slipped my legs into the smoothest leggings ever made. They allowed for great range of motion, and I made it through a 5-mile run in the Fast & Free tights without having to pull them back into place. I lifted in the Pace Rival Crop, and the experience was equally enjoyable. And I'm in love with the slide pockets on the legs! The leggings were so comfortable that I forgot I was even wearing them. After the first wear, I would have given 10 stars for each!!
Unfortunately, after washing according to care instructions and hanging dry a couple of times, BOTH pairs seem to have stretched out and are no longer true to size. The legs seem too large, the bottom stretched and isn't as form-fitting anymore, and I have to cinch the drawstring at the waist about 4 inches in order to keep them in place. It's hard to enjoy and focus on a workout when I'm constantly tugging at my leggings to keep them in place. I lift 4 days a week and run 5 days a week, so having the right apparel is crucial. The price tag on these leggings was high, but I was willing to pay it for leggings that seemed so perfect when I tried them on and during my first few workouts with each.

When I wear an 8, the waistband feels a little too tight for my liking. When I wear a 10, it feels perfect but the crotch area/upper thighs sag/fall a little. It's bizarre because the waist stays in place but I have to hike up the thigh area fabric a lot. Maybe this is my fault because I am between sizes.

At the 6 month timeline they are a bit stretched out and I have to pull them up when I run plus the colors begin fading. But we had a great 6 months together!

These pants are my favorite style for running around, going on a walk, or stretching after a run and shower. I don't really wear them for running as I prefer shorts if it's warm enough to wear this material. The material is perfect if you have animals, since their hair won't stick to it. I love to wear these with a sweater or just a t-shirt depending on where I'm going. The waistband could even be a little looser, in my opinion, but I'm thankful it's not as tight as some lulu options where I can't breathe if I get the right size for everywhere else (this might be a petite girl problem, since the waistband is always coming up higher on me than most people).

I own over 30 pairs of lulu leggings, and mentioned that the align pant II were my absolute favorite fit, finish, feel and look, and the Educator directed me towards the Fast and Free, which had the same naked feeling as the align pant II, but would offer more structure and stability for sprints on the tread. I liked the idea of the pant, and loved how they looked on, and was thrilled to have found the ""align pant II"" of running. I ordered my regular size (4), had slight issues with the waistband falling during my run, but that's not a huge issue for me and i'm willing to keep pulling the pants up because I love high-rise fits so much.
However, after one HIIT workout, these pants have already come apart literally at the seams, rendering the pants unwearable. I have done the same exact workouts in my wunder unders and align pant II's, as well as leggings from similar yogi-centric brands such as Alo, Beyond, Lorna Jane, and all have withstood beautifully. Additionally, I have been wearing, washing, and taking care of lulus for over 7 years now, so negligence is out of the question. To have a legging that is made for yoga, a low-intensity workout, out-perform a legging designed for running--a high-intensity, high-friction workout--is simply embarrassing. Along with buying these pants, I also bought the all the right places crop, which, so far, after one single workout, haven't fallen apart quite yet, so that may be a better bet than these, although the ATRP crop material doesn't feel quite as nice as the fast and free's.
To have stumbled upon the seemingly perfect legging suited to my preferred workout and lifestyle, and then to have it fall apart after one wear and wash is already devastating, and to have that pant then cost $128 should frankly be illegal.",1 out of 5,MEECHIE,"MANHATTAN, NEW YORK, NY, USA",RUNNER,18-24,SLIM,just right,fabric,poor quality,2018-09-15,3,0,"{'LL_response_content': 'Hey meechie,\n\nThanks for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

I purchased these leggings, size 4, and I've found that the thin fabric is constantly sliding down.

They are perfect for fall,spring and summer since the fabric is thin. I love how the fabric is breathable and feel like a second skin. You are not restricted by the fabric in any way and can move freely but at the same time the waist band is tight enough to hold the pant in place while you are moving and avoids sliding. The tight has side pockets, which are a “must” in my opinion for running/hiking. I always prefer the side pockets over the back one.
However, the side pockets in the fast and free pull to the side if you don’t have thin legs....it’s probsbly due to my thighs being wider than my waist.
That would be the only reason for this tight not to be perfect. I have tried to size up to a size 6 and see if that helps, but it doesn’t.
I also see that issue on %99 of my clients that wear the F&F.

They've got a perfect high waist and 7/8 length with the best pockets for all your necessities for a long run.
But ohhhhh my goodness the sweat that shows on these babies is incredible. I first purchased a black pair as I made my venture back in to the running world. I instantly fell in love and decided another pair would be great to alternate with my newly coveted basic blacks - even though I did notice some fraying with the stitching within the first couple wears and first wash. (to be honest, it wasn't a HUGE deal since they were so comfortable and prevented any discomfort or chafing while running longer distances)
I requested a second pair as a gift and was lucky enough to receive a beautiful teal colour. I continued to use my black pair and decided to save the new teal ones for an upcoming race.
I did one of my tapered runs pre-race and wore my race outfit just to make sure everything was comfortable and was shocked to find an incredibly noticeable ""she pee'd her pants"" sweat mark after 20 mins in to my run.
I know I am one to sweat when I work hard - but most times would like for it to be a little more discreet than it was with these tights.
In true lululemon form, customer service was incredible as always and offered to return my tights. I am hoping to purchase a similar pair... in a darker colour!

I tried it on in store and i fell in love with how comfortable and lightweight this legging feels. The workers were very knowledgeable and counseled me on how to care for the leggings. After 2-3 wears and only hanging dry them, I started noticing the stitching are very fuzzy and falling apart!!!!! It looks like little fuzzy balls handing from the stitching!! It is so noticeable that I feel uncomfortable wearing it out!!!! It is so disappointing because i wanted to love these so much! Especially for the price i paid i expected way better quality than what I received.

This shows crazy amount of sweat in the crotch whenever I am actually working out. This has never happened to me with other Lululemon pants.
I wore this to the gym for the first time when I did HIIT cycling. I walked away with a seat shaped wetness on my crotch/butt from the sweat. The next time I wore them I finished my workout with a ski erg sprint workout. It was short-maybe just 7-10 minutes. Regardless, in that amount of time the sweat accumulated on my hip creases and crotch area. Also, I have had to wash them after each wear because it stains so easily- I can see where my previous sweat marks were, so I can’t wear them after the gym to run errands even after they dry. They show every little mark very clearly, so even as a casual wear they are not great (say a long road trip where you are eating snacks).

However, these leggings are undoubtedly the best leggings LuluLemon offers. I have tried legitimately every single staple Lululemon legging: All the Right Places, Align, Wunder Under Luon and Luxtreme, etc. and these ones take the cake. These leggings are made for every single exercise you can imagine. I have done Spin classes, yoga classes, weight training, HIIT circuits, running, and Pilates classes and these leggings have held up so well! I'm a sweaty monster and these pants actually wick away the sweat from all of my workouts pretty well. One of my absolute favorite features is the number of pockets these pants have; I can put my keys, wallet, phone, and pretty much everything in all of the pockets these pants offer. The only cons I have noticed so far are the general thinness of the pants material, slight pilling along the waist band, and the overall cost of these pants. These pants are definitely a mix of the Aligns and All the Right Places Pants/Luxtreme material. The pants have the durability and sweat-wicking of the Luxtreme and the thin/almost-naked sensation of the Aligns. Unfortunately, these pants are thin, scarily thin. I've had problems with previous LuluLemon leggings randomly popping holes in extremely unfortunate areas (Inspire leggings and extremely mortifying crotch legging) and due to the thinness of the material, I am worried every single time I open my legs that another random hole might pop up. As for the pilling along the waistband, I understand it's pretty difficult for any clothing company to fight the pill, so I'm not exactly surprised that my pants have started pilling after 3-4 months. Additionally, the waistband is starting to wear out a bit, along with the fabric along the legs. One thing I wish Lululemon could adjust is the price. I understand that these are probably the best, most functional leggings Lulu can produce, but $128?! It's incredibly expensive and made me hesitate when buying my first pair and question buying a second pair. However, regardless of the cost, slight pilling, and thin fabric, these are THE best Lululemon leggings you could buy right now if you do more than just yoga and lounge in your leggings!",4 out of 5,JANESMITH2424,"SCOTTSDALE, AZ, USA",SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,ATHLETIC,roomy,durability,thin fabric,2018-03-05,4,0,{}

The pockets are absolutely wonderful and from what I can tell, they are so much more spacious than the pockets in the Speed Up tight. I have placed my keys, phone charger, and phone in these pockets simultaneously and they have yet to stretch out. The side pockets fit literally everything which makes the leggings so much more convenient. I am aware that there are three pockets in the back of the waistband but I haven't found any use for them so far. The day after I got the leggings, I wore them with my knee-high Hunter boots, and found that on my right leg below my knee (where the boots go up to), the fabric had become, for lack of a better word, fuzzy. Additionally, within a few days I noticed that some of the seams on the back of my left calf were unraveling, but I just trimmed them with scissors. I accidentally washed and machine-dried them with all of my other, non-athletic clothes, and was worried that they would be ruined, but was delighted to find that they remained intact. Ever since, I've been washing them normally with my everyday clothes and I have experienced no issues with the leggings. Side note: they definitely ""mold"" to your body; I am 130lb 5'4"" with 27"" waist and I got a size 2. They were originally very difficult to put on but since have become easier.

They're a substantially thinner material than what I'm used to and they're a bit pricier than my normal lulu tights. After chatting with one of the Educators, she assured me the tights were fantastic for crossfit and would change my workouts. My first time wearing them I was terrified they would be see-through, but once I got used to the material I loved how light weight the tights were.
I got my tights in December and by mid-January I noticed they had already begun to wear out. The tights seemed thinner than before and the material seemed to get looser and stretch out. I was shocked at how the material changed after only a month of wear. Although they were not what they used to be I still wore them on rotation with my other tights and took proper care of them.
This past week I was devastated when I was asked by one of my friends in class how my tights ripped. I realized the knee of my tight had a small hole that ripped open. I don't know when in my workout it happened, but I'm so upset that these tights couldn't last through a standard WOD like my other gear. What I love about all of my other lulu tights is how durable they are, I've never had to think twice about them, but these tights ripping within three months of purchase was so upsetting.
DO NOT buy these tights if you do any kind of high impact training. If they can't last through a crossfit WOD, I can't imagine how these would last through a longer workout. I feel like I just wasted $130 that I could have put towards more durable gear. I wear strictly lulu in the gym, and I love the quality of my gear, but these aren't even minimally comparable. I can't wear these tights in the gym anymore because I'm worried the rip will get bigger. Lulu, you need to fix the design of these, and don't encourage your Educators to recommend gear for something they can't withstand.

I was just getting back into working out after a little hiatus. I used to be a lulu-extremist but over the last few years, I stopped due to the change in material that did not entice me. These pants are unlike the luon Lululemon pants. I wouldn't describe the material as buttery which I reserve for the Align pants, but find these pants to be more like slippery (Sort of how shiny pants are slippery- these pants are not shiny though!!). They do not slip off when wearing them, just when you run your hands over them there is less friction. When I started training again, I was a size 6 in these pants and what I love about them is that they are high-waisted and have a drawstring. I need high-waisted workout pants or I find they start to fall down. Additionally, the drawstring allows me to continue to workout and train in these pants even though my size has shrunk! This is fantastic when you are spending 140 on a pair of pants. I also find that these are perfect for working out because they do not pill. I have been consistently working out in these pants for 6 months and not one issue with the material or seams. I think this is in part due to the more slippery texture, it resists the friction that causes pilling. I also find that these pants let your body breath and do not feel restricting; something I really hate. Lastly, as a dog owner, a big problem I have with leggings or workout pants is dog hair sticking. Again because of the different material my dog's hair does not stick. This makes my life so much easier. When I need to workout and these lulus are still hanging to dry (following the washing instructions is important to the longevity of any of my Lulu-pants), I dread working out in my other workout pants. These are just the best, the best feel, the best quality, the best mobility, and they give me the best workouts.",5 out of 5,BAILEY88,"TORONTO, ON, CANADA",SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,CURVY,snug,drawstring,,2018-02-16,3,0,{}

Half of my closet is just lulu gear. And I had heard about quality issues before, but had never really experienced it myself, beyond just the stretching and regular wear and tear that comes with continuous use. But I've never experienced anything like this before, both in the quality of the tights, and in the customer service policy surrounding them.
The first time I wore them, I noticed that a seam on the pocket coming apart. I took them to the store to see if I can get them exchanged, only to find out that the colour that I bought is no longer sold (part of the reason I had purchased these tights was because of the very pretty colour). Even though I was within the return period, because I had taken off the tag, I was not allowed to get my money back or even a gift card to the store. The only options I was given was to have it taken to a tailor for repair or choose something from the store right then and there to exchange for it.
I chose to get the tights repaired. When I got them back, it looked ok. The seam that was resewn was a lot thicker than the original and looked kind of clunky, but I let it go, because I didn't want to deal with it anymore. I've worn the tights only a couple of times since, and I notice that the seam on the inside of the calf is also starting to come apart.
It's just frustrating to deal with these issues with a pair of $140 leggings. It's also disappointing that there's isn't any accommodation for a refund or at least store credit when there is clearly a major quality issue with the leggings. This experience has kind of put me off lulu.
So beware. They may feel nice and super comfy, but they'll start falling apart in no time and lulu's policies may not be all that helpful.",1 out of 5,HEARTLY,,YOGI,25-34,,,,worst quality ever,2018-02-14,2,1,"{'LL_response_content': ""Hey Heartly,\nThanks for connecting with us.

Ever.,"A store associate recommended these to me while I was trying on other items, noting that the length is great for us short gals because it's a perfect full length for our short legs. I thought they looked bad on display due to the raw style hem on the ankles, but I reluctantly tried them on anyways. Whoa. I loved the feel of them immediately, so silky soft, comfortable, flattering (and I'm curvy, so that's hard to come by), and supportive. I momentarily considered maxing out my credit card and buying every color.
I've since worn them hiking (in temps ranging from 30 to 50 degrees), at the gym, around town, and to many barre classes. Their breathability is remarkable - they maintain reasonable warmth outside yet keep me cool when I'm working up a good sweat indoors, and their comfort is absolutely unparalleled. I have owned them for about 3 months and have had no issues with the seams unraveling or pilling, aside from a tiny bit of pilling around the ankle which is my own fault for wearing them with boots around town.

I have never spent this much on a pair of workout pants before. I usually buy from Athleta and was told from an employee in the store how the quality of Lululemon far exceeded Athleta, so I decided to take the plunge. (And I now regret it...I will stick with Athleta from now on). I had only worn these pants about 5 or 6 times in the 3-4 months since I owned them. I had washed them in cool water and never dried them. I was being particularly cautious because they were so expensive. I put them on to go for a run and noticed something felt weird on my butt. I took the pants off and it looked like they were beginning to run in several places on one side only. When I went to exchange them, the sales associate told me that it looked like I had sat down on concrete. I am 100% certain that I am not responsible for the runs in the material and have never sat on concrete, but even if I had, in only a few times of wearing them, if I needed to sit on a curb to tie my shoes, the material should be able to withstand that. After being asked how I washed them, if I had used fabric softener (no), and a few other accusatory questions, I let her know that I only wanted to exchange them, not return them and then she relented. I was completely embarrassed at this point and getting side-eye glances from another associate who clearly thought I was lying. Ugh.

I think I can only say good things about them aside from ONE little issue - the waistband is a little bit too thin to me, I like a thick waistband and I feel like length wise it is definitely wide but the thickness isn't there. Overall though if you're looking for your first pair of Lulu's or just a perfect all around, every sport compatible kind of legging, these are the ones!
I wear these for rock climbing, tennis, lifting, anything.
The GOOD:
- Really nicely fitted and flattering look.
- Pockets on the sides that don't stretch out in the wash.
- Pockets on the waistband TOO, little ones all around the waist (so smart)
- The 7/8 length is perfect for petite girls (It's normal length basically..)
- The Luxtreme fabric is VERY thin and second skin like, but it doesn't pill or gather up lint at all.
- Stays up during my workouts no matter what I do (So important!!)
The BAD:
- It's laser cut so this is kind of a good and bad thing - the cut is nice but just note that you CANNOT have this one hemmed to fit you - the length you get is the one you stick with, whether it's cropped or long.
- The waistband is a little bit uncomfortable at times because of how thin it is but it's a mangeable thing and I wouldn't want these to change too much!
Would (and have) recommend these to all my friends. They're great for dashing out and working out. The pockets on the side and waistband are REAL winners for me - I put my keys in the waistband and my phone in the pockets and they've never fallen out nor have the pockets stretched out over continued use.
I am 5'3"" and wear a size 12 - these fit TTS but I think sizing down to a size 10 wouldn't hurt if you wanted something even MORE fitted.

My biggest issue with these is that the waist has stretched out majorly over the past six months.

However, after the second time I wore them, I was in a lululemon store when I noticed the seams on the butt began to look furry or something. The girl at the store was so gracious and had me bring them back later to sort it out. Since I loved the color and they were out of it to exchange, I decided to keep that pair of pants and just get the seams fixed. Once I got them back, I've worn the sparingly because of how much I love the color and fabric and was scared to ruin them.
But now, I've worn the pants just a handful of times (either just around or maybe pilates) and the pants stretch out so much near the crotch that I have to constantly pull them up and they just look plain weird. AND PLUS I've noticed the seam starting to fuzz up again!!!
The main reason why I love lulu is for the quality, and this is the first pair that I've really had issues with.

I'm a longtime lulu customer and have had countless tights and crops over the years and these are by far my all time favorite.

Love the high waist of course which prevents any muffin top, and really like the unfinished hem because it's so smooth, and doesn't rub, yet the pants stay in place without riding up. (I also have all the crops in this style and the hem on those can sometimes ride up since its closer to your knee, but they're still not uncomfortable. and I actually prefer the crop length). Big plus -- these pants also are not see through! Despite the light feel when you put them on, the fabric actually feels and looks like a more dense weave than many luxtreme pants and I haven't found this nulux fabric to be see through at all, even on the lighter prints (haven't tried the lighter solids so I can't comment on that).

These are the only tights that make my skin feel good & don’t cause me bruising or skin issues. Super light fabric, low compression.
But, I have to agree with other reviewers, the threading comes loose easily. I returned a pair after the threads on the front seam came loose.

I write this review in the hopes that people will give these a try. I have over 20 pairs of lulus (and various other brands) and have tried all evolutions of their leggings and crops for over 10 years. Each fabric and style has pluses and minuses - but this legging does it all. Flattering, comfortable, cute details on the ankles - really the best legging so far. First, you have to feel the fabric - it is REALLY buttery soft. They say that this has that ""naked"" feeling - I prefer a bit of feeling hugged - so I sized down from my usual 8 to a 6 with no issues. The thing that is really spectacular on these ones (as opposed to the 'all the right places' or 'tight stuff') this has a kind of side seam (you can see it in the pictures) that keeps any thigh imperfections to a minimum. This is important because these thinner fabrics (I am looking at you nulu used in the pushing limits crop) are cooler for hot temps - but don't leave a lot to the imagination. This 7/8 pant - I have the black, black with white dots and the green leopard-y looking one - is my number one favorite pant from lulu of all time. I have had no issues with the seams. I machine wash with tide pure and hang dry. EVERY time. Stays in place while running and I don't bother to tie the drawstring. Keeps you cool. Really a great legging.

The fabric feels pretty amazing and the fit is nice. I love when I don't have to tailor my lulu. I'm 4""11 and the length was just right. But if you're taller, it will look great on you! All things positive has its negative. My only issue was the seam around the waistline started to unravel all around my waist. When I wear a crop top or just a sports bra, you can see fuzzy seams that developed all around my waistline due to the seams that had unravel. At first when I saw the unraveling happen I didn't want to pull it so I just cut the small piece off with scissors. Then I wore them a couple more times and and MORE parts started to unravel. I eventually ended up with a collection of all the pieces I cut off. I had bought these for some time now and never washed them because I hardly wore them and I am now afraid to wash them. I don't even want to wear them anymore because due to more unraveling mess.

The fabric is truly wonderful and feels great on the skin. Fast forward to when I received them still felt great, then ... I wore them to work out. First wear, snag on the seams. Kept working out... more snags. This is on non contact areas too! Seams on the front, the pockets, etc. Basically everywhere with a thread. Cut off the snags bits on the surface then decided to wear them a second time... to walk my dogs. By the end of my 5 block walk the threading on the front (not even inner thighs) snagged! I don't even know from what!! This is the first time I've written a review on their new online system. I used to purchase $$$'s every online upload day around 4 years ago. Quality has never been the same and I have only purchased 5 items since the last 4 years. I don't know how quality is so terrible yet the prices have significantly increased. Pants never used to be more than $98. Wunder under crops were $68! Swiftly Long sleeves were $64 now they're $78 in a few years! These prices and quality make zero sense.

It looses only after 2 washes, especially the keen, the loose is obviously, actually I did asked the sales people in store if it may unshaped when I was making the decision about the size, they emphasized it will not unshaped at all.
Recently, I found the line unstitched at the bottom of the pants, the off line goes up to the waist, who should I contact with about this? I really worried if it may get worse or splitopen. (I am 126 lbs, 173 cm, I bought size 4)

I just received these yesterday via the mail so I haven't worked out in them yet. So of course, I tried them on and they feel like silk! I mean I was able to slip them on like butter and they feel amazing; they have a very comfy cooling sensation. Now I'm relatively new to Lululemon and only have three leggings. In the Hot Like Angi leggings that I purchased last month the size 8 fit perfectly. Now either these leggings run a bit big or I'm losing weight but the size 8 in these are slightly big. I mean they look and feel amazing and are not too big or loose for me to exchange them, not that I could because the size 6 in the gray/dark carbon color is sold out, but when I buy the nile blue color I will size down. Because I just received these I haven't fully worked out ( I do kickboxing, strength training, TCX and cross fit) in them yet, but I did do several burpees and jumping jacks, even ran around my apt to see how they hold up and I'm satisfied with how durable they are. The waist band did slide down a bit, again because they are a bit loose but after doing 15 burpees overall the tights held in place.
They're are some reviews that say these tights are completely not see throw in the dark carbon-well for them that may be true, but for me not so much. Honestly these leggings are about 10% sheer, but nothing outrageous. I mean they do pass the squat test! For me unfortunately I have a spot of cellulite the size of a nickel on the back of my right thigh that does show through and when trying these on with normal VS cotton panties you could see the pantie line which happens to be the case with most leggings these days.
Still love these. At the moment I'm 5'3 157 lb small upper body curvy lower body. Normally were size M or size 29 or 8 in jeans and size 8 in BEBE dresses. Highly recommend!",5 out of 5,HOLLYNOEL06,"GILBERT, AZ, USA",,25-34,CURVY,,color size fit durability,slightly sheer,2017-06-30,5,0,{}

I love all the pockets; they really make these perfect running tights, as I can hold gels, my keys, my ID, and my phone. If I had one suggestion on the pockets though, it would be to make a more secure ID pocket with a zipper or a fold-over flap; I am always concerned my ID is going to fall out. The fabric is very lightweight and comfortable, and definitely goes along with the ""naked"" sensation. I bought these in nile blue and the color is pretty.
