However, recently I have been really disappointed with the quality of lulu's products. I bought a pair of these tights less than a month ago and they already have a hole in the knee (I did not snag them on anything), some of the seams are starting to come undone and there is some signs of wear on the material at the top of my right thigh. I have always taken really good care of my lulu clothing as it is so expensive and I am on a student budget so I need to last so I do not understand what is going on. But I am really not impressed and am quite disappointed by the quality of these tights. Besides the poor quality, I really like the fit and style of these tights. The stitching is very flattering and the side pockets are the perfect place to slip your phone in when you are going for a run. But, if you don't have money to burn, I would not recommend these tights as they didn't even last a month for me and I am scared to wear them now because I do not want to make the hole any bigger. I really hope lulu steps their quality game back up, as I find it super frustrating to spend so much money on a pair of tights to only be able to wear them for less than a month.",2 out of 5,SAR7152,"PETERBOROUGH, ON",RUNNER,UNDER 18,ATHLETIC,,pockets,quality,2018-03-20,0,0,"{'LL_response_content': 'Hey Sar7152,\nThanks for reaching out and providing this feedback for us.
