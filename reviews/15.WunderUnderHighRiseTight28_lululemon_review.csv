I bought a pair last year, and they are my FAVORITE. I would say that because they are knit, they are a little different than regular luon: softer, thicker, and they just look super cool. I do CrossFit and I don't wear them for my toughest/messiest workouts (because they are too nice), but I do wear them for less intense work (e.g., stretching, running, coaching...). Mostly, they are my favorite general purpose ""athletic"" leggings. I think the knit style makes them look a little classier, so I will wear them to work, out and about, or just to lounge at home.

I had tried on Aligns and Wunder Unders - I tried both the Luon and Luxtreme fabrics in the Wunder Unders and decided to go with the Luon. I liked both but slightly leaned towards the Luon since it was matte and would go more with my everyday clothes. The deciding factor was that the sales associate said the Luon material would take YEARS to pill as long as I washed in cold and hung dry (and she said the Luxtreme would NEVER pill - is that true?). So I went with the Luon since I figured I would get years of wear out of it before it pilled.
Well, I've worn the leggings about 5 times over the past few weeks that I've owned them and it's already pilling. I've only done errands and no workouts in them :( Even though they are insanely comfortable, I wouldn't pay $100 for leggings that pill after a few wears. My $20 TJMaxx leggings have worn much better than these. I totally thought I would join the Lulu cult for a hot minute because the leggings DO feel very good, but am sorely disappointed.

I've always loved Lululemon for their crops, hoodies and tanks, so I figured it'd be worth the $98 to give their leggings a try too. I asked the associate about the piling issue I've read about & she assured me it's mostly due to improper care/washing. So I purchased them earlier this week, excitedly wore them for a long day of classes at school & realized they were piling on the inner thigh by the middle of the day...haven't even thrown them into the wash yet in fear of making them pile more.

They've all held up beautifully, still soft and thick and just as stretchy as when they were new. I wanted to add to my collection, so I ordered another black pair online. I've been buying Lululemon since you only had one store on 4th in Vancouver, and have watched the quality slowly take a dive over the years, but your products were still acceptable for the most part. However, this latest pair of leggings is going right back to the store. Thin, cheap, gross-feeling fabric, weird calf shaping to the legs, and they're at least an inch shorter in the waist than my old ones - they're barely high-waisted anymore (I'm comparing them laid flat from the waist seam to the top, so I'm not just getting fatter or something). Not worth $100 by any means. Never mind the time it took me to sort through your products to figure out what your ""normal"" fabric is called now, and what the heck is the standard pant length - different product pages with different lengths in different colours and different fabrics, no real explanation of how the fabrics differ. I was stupid not to read the reviews - nearly all of the most recent ones are negative. Lululemon will always have new customers who don't know what you used to be like, so I know you'll never hurt for profit, but maybe you'll eventually take these reviews seriously and make something worth buying again.

I can go to the gym, sit in my lectures, and even wear them under my scrub pants! They fit great in my legs, butt, and waist, and I certainly am a fan of the high-waisted aspect of these pants.
They're comfortable and seriously make you feel like taking over the world just got a little easier.",5 out of 5,GBA14,"SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA",RUNNER,18-24,CURVY,,high waist,,2017-03-24,2,0,{}

I have been shopping at Lulu Lemon for a decade and they have always had really high quality activewear. They have started making a lot of new pants some great, some not so great. Yes I like that these are high rise and black pants but they are thin and I had to send the first pair back with a hole...Now i have had the second pair for about 4 months and they are pilling in the thighs. The girls at the store have now told me some of the materials are for specific workouts. Thinner material pants are ok for Yoga or just hanging out in your house but when your hitting the gym hard or running they will pill and won't stand up. Like I said I have been buying pants from Lulu for a long time and its really disappointing that now I have to make sure my pants are made for my specific activity, maybe that should be on the tag or something. For pants that are minimum $100 I think I should be able to wear them pretty much for any activity, haven't heard of this issue with any other brand of activewear.",2 out of 5,SADLULU25,,,,,,high rise,pilled in leg,2017-02-01,15,4,"{'LL_response_content': ""Hey sadlulu25,\nWe hear your disappointment and know that we stand behind the quality of our gear.
