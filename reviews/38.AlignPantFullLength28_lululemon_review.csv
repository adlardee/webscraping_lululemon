-Very early minuscule slight signs of pilling in a certain area after wearing just three times. My bad for not having a thigh gap.
-While I don't care about pilling for vanity reasons, this could be a durability concern in the future. I haven't owned them long enough to know for sure.

Unfortunately, the blue color shows sweat! A LOT.

I scurried out of that class grateful that I wasn't stuck in a barre class or something else where sweat is at a minimum and it would be noticed much more!

I'm pregnant with my third child and no stranger to crummy pregnancy leggings, so I was more than willing to pay more for something that would last. I did size up although a lot of reviews said it wasn't necessary, and they have continued to stretch and fit well throughout my pregnancy. One pair lasted a few months (only worn a few times) before starting to pill at the inner thigh. The other pair began to pill after 2-3 wears. I contacted Lulu and received a replacement pair, which honestly began pilling on the first wear. They're now (after probably 10 wears) pilled all the way down to the calf. I'm a longtime Lululemon customer and have some of the original Wunder Unders as well as a bunch of tops that have lasted for years.

1. The fabric is incredibly soft. Feels like you're wearing nothing. Nice colors available, I bought in dark carbon.
Cons:
1. MAJOR pilling after only one wear/wash. It exponentially gets worse with every wear/wash even if you follow instructions. I ignored reviews and I wish I hadn't.
2. the pocket is useless - putting anything in the pocket makes a really uncomfortable bulge and it's too small for anything other than a few credit cards or a single key (not attached to a key ring)
3. Usually wear a size 2, but size down in these. Luckily, Lulu sells a size 0 in the 25"" pants.
Overall, don't buy these unless you're rich and can afford to buy a new pair every month.

A common complaint throughout many lululemon and ivivva reviews was the durability, pilling, and sliding. I have worn lulu's 3 main fabrics in the pants the Luon, Luxtreme, and now the Nulu.
I have had this exact pairs of Align's for a year now and they are hands down my favorite. They are in fairly good condition with no real pilling, it does begin to gather but compared to the ivivva pilling, it is manageable and unnoticeable. These pants are thin and fit very nicely with no excess fabric gathering anywhere. But because they are thin, I have heard, not yet experienced, holes in the pants. The inside of the pants are cool and almost slick while the outside has the ""buttery soft"" feel and stays in place very well!
In contrast, the Wunder Under or the Luon products, they are MUCH thicker and tighter. I have a pair in the crop and love that they are very durable and I feel more confident wearing them rock climbing because of the thickness. They also have not pilled yet, however are not my favorite because of the thickness, in the full length they feel very tight and almost clunky. The Luxtreme has the similar thickness to the Luon but feels slick on both side. However, they aren't my favorite because they constantly slide down but they do have that nice durability.
Overall, these pants are my go to to wear and I absolutely love them and considering buying another pair but I am still not too sure if I would wear them to go climbing knowing that there is a higher chance of getting a hole in $100 pants...really wishing there was a perfect rock climbing leggings!",4 out of 5,FRISBEANS,,,,,just right,fit,durability,2018-11-21,8,0,{}

Making this investment meant investing in a legging that would last me a significant amount of time while being cautious of its use and durability. So, I made my purchase in Dec of 2017. A store rep explained to me its intended use and noted how to properly clean them. 5 measly months later.. I am left with a $100 pair of leggings covered in pills! I went to my nearby lulu for some assistance, asking for a replacement legging as I did love the feel of them compared to all other name brand leggings I previously purchased. However, I was scolded by the customer service saying that ""I must have misused them"" and did not offer any sort of support. One store rep told me the best she could do was send my pair in to get cleaned of the pilling. Great! I received my pair back 4 weeks later with maybe have the pilling on.

I have very bad arthritis and fibromyalgia, leaving my body crazy sensitive to pressure. I was afraid at my age to walk into a Lululemon store. I thought the new size 14 might be loose enough for me. I was the only 'old' person in the store. I was very shy to speak to anyone there. I didn't think other sizes would fit. I have lived in Yoga clothes from other brands, but their promised light compression is painful and just not light enough. Lulu's promise of feeling 'naked' sounded very good to me. I took a few pairs of Align Pants 28"" off sale rack (Size 12), and tried them on. I almost cried. I was astonished. They didn't hurt me. I tried on many different items, jackets, pants etc. and they all fit beautifully in a 12 (there was no 14 to try on). Nulu is my future wardrobe. I hope they bring out the revived Groove yoga pant I read about recently in the Nulu fabric. I sure could use a pair of flares for evening wear. LuluLemon you rock, I hope other elderly folks will read this and as I did, get themselves into a store to try on some amazing clothing to wear.

I brought them back to the store and spoke with a salesperson who agreed that they definitely felt different, and it's possible it was a different type of fabric used.

I typically purchase the wunder under tights because I like the compression but because Im pregnant, needed more stretch and less compression obviously. I wore them a few times, and I always wash with other athletic clothes and lay fly to dry, as I do with all lululemon gear. These tights have never ever been in a dryer or washed with fabric softener. I only wore these a few times in the spring because my jeans still fit at that point. However, it's been such a hot summer that Ive lived in shorts and had the tights stashed away. I recently pulled them out to wear them again and the piling is unbelievable. I havent even exercised in them- I'm wearing them mostly to run errands and around the house. There is piling on the inside of the thighs from them rubbing together which is totally justifiable.. but the amount of piling on the front of the thighs and generally all over the pants is unacceptable. I wear fitted shirts so no other material is rubbing that would cause this. I have many lululemon items which I take excellent care of because of the cost- overall I feel like the quality lives up to the price but not with these pants.

First, the reviews are true; they pill pretty badly and the seams become frayed almost immediately, but only where your legs rub. I have remedied this by buying a cheap fabric shaver and cleaning them up every month or so. Second, the camouflage is a slightly different material due to the pattern and therefore DOES NOT PILL (yay!!). The pants are beyond comfortable and stretch like crazy without stretching out... I wore them through 9 months of pregnancy (literally every single day at the end) and they still fit after pregnancy back at my normal size. Should a $100 pair of pants have the issues they have?

Either with more water and rinsing or with a bit of time the water marks disappear on their own. Not a deal breaker for me but I know this can drive some woman nuts - so beware of the lighter colours if this bothers you.

The full length pant has actually pilled right where my seatbelt does up in my vehicle. I have smooth leather seats, so it's obviously the belt clip that's causing the problem. The crotch area also has excessive pilling, and now a large thread has started to come out. I treat all Lulu items with care, and I've worn these sparingly, knowing about the pilling issue.

They are buttery soft and fit so well. For me personally, it’s a size down item. In my TTS(4) they had 0 compression, but in a size down(2) they had some compression without being sheer.
I recommend sizing down and doing the “bent test”(some light colors might be sheer).
I own 16 pairs (some crops) and I really like them for teaching a class but I wouldn’t run in them.
They are very delicate and prone to pilling.

I told the Associate I needed pants that allowed me to work freely as a therapist and she said these felt 'like butter' - I Totally concur!
The pants feel amazing, I love wearing them, my legs and butt look great in them, and they aren't so tight that it's uncomfortable like the compression pants Lulu sells which I also own (forget the name). They are way more moveable if that makes sense.
The one sad thing is I only work 1 - 2 days a week, and only wear the pants for work, not to mention I am a freak about washing my Lululemon clothing. It all gets washed together on delicate cycle with natural detergent and no softener, I hang it to dry, etc. I never sit on wood benches or concrete or anything that could pill it, I never let it in contact with velcro - etc - all that to say I am hardcore about caring for my Lulu clothing, most of which has lasted me 5 - 7 years! But these pants, after only a few shifts of wearing them and a few washes, began pilling like crazy on the seams, and now they are even pilling all over the front and backs of the leg part too. I know the associate had said these need extra care, but even with all the extra care, they still pill, so I'm really sad about that.

I have been a loyal Lululemon buyers for the better part of 8 years. As a pilates instructor and avid exerciser, lulu was my jam. The original Wunder Unders are literally the best pants in the world (more on that another time, I won't touch the current wunder unders).
Overall, I have to say that though back in the day, lulu was consistently high quality, things are very hit or miss these days. The Align pants are hit and miss all in one.
The fit is great, the feel is fabulous, and the lengths are perfection.
That said, the pants pill like no other, and they hold onto smell as well. I have just come to expect that my aligns will pill between the legs even after 1 or 2 wears. I wish Lulu would fix this, I really do, but then I really do wonder how much can be done.

My first time in the store I spent about $700 and bought not one but THREE pairs of the Align Pant as they were the best thing I had ever put on my body. After just ONE MONTH, I noticed the first pair starting to pill and then became even more careful in my handwashing process. I have always hand washed my lulu pants and laid flat to dry as instructed, but low and behold, every pair of these heavenly leggings began to pill and look cheap. For $98 this is shameful. Lulu has definitely let go of their high standards in the past couple of years. What a shame that their newfound popularity has inspired them to cut corners. I have $30 pairs of leggings that have lasted me much better. That being said I have also purchased $100 leggings from real yoga companies that have been worth the money and kept the same high quality for over a year.

The good:
SO soft, so comfortable, so flattering. These were my primary travel day pant and have been on me during many long train, bus, and plane rides. They are crazy comfortable. Sometimes I would use the secret pocket during sketchy bus rides.
They are super flattering, versatile, and go with everything. Seriously- I could wear these on the street in La Paz and they pass for pants. I wore them climbing a volcano in Guatemala and they are perfect active wear. Hiking in the Himalayas, scootering in Italy, you get the point, they go everywhere.
Other advantages as a travel pant- they pack small, and dry quickly, which is important as i had to do hand laundry and line dry many, many times.
The not so good-- a couple months into my trip, the pants started showing signs of wear-- specifically pilling in the thigh area. This was disappointing for the price and otherwise fantastic quality.

Initially, great pants. They feel super smooth and comfortable and work great for my purposes (boot camp, yoga, hot yoga). They also worked very well for me because I'm tall (5'11"") with pretty long legs. I didn't wash them, but I would cold rinse them after hot yoga and let them air dry. They inevitably get wet when you do C2 at Corepower (very hot and sweaty!)
Unfortunately, their condition did not last, despite me handling them pretty delicately. The threads started to split from the pants and the texture was not the same. Now they feel worn and rough to the touch, like I've had them for years. It only took a month or two before I noticed the difference, so too long to realistically return them. If they had been $20, I would say, ""Ok, whatever"" and donate them. But $98 pants should last and that was my intention. I essentially wore them every weekend (did yoga approximately twice per week). So, as much as I was thrilled initially, lululemon products should last and these just did not.

I've had great luck with the full-on luxtreme fabric for my high intensity workouts, but wanted the aligns for general lounging and sometimes for yoga. I'm a size 8 in pants with compression etc, but sized down to a 6 in the aligns (I'm 5'6 150 lbs measurements 36-28-39) and the 6 fits perfectly. The nulu fabric is like a dream...these are snug yet lightweight and feel like silk on the skin. The high rise is very nice and I feel awesome in these pants! Got the full length in black. They aren't see through either. I've had them since mid-October, wear about once a week... haven't experienced pilling yet and have just had a tiny snag on one of the seams when I accidentally rubbed a snow boot against it (think the little metal thing on the boot did it). But this isn't noticeable and doesn't affect my opinion of the quality at all! I just ordered the ""night view white black"" color and am not sure how I feel about it. The pants fit nicely, the print fabric feels a tiny bit more compression-y and there is a slight sheen to the fabric that I'm not sure I love. There is a white lining inside so they look see-through when I bend over but only due to the white background and contrast with the black seam. I might return this one, but if they are back in stock in black I would buy another pair.",4 out of 5,CLASSICMS,"PROVIDENCE, RI",SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,ATHLETIC,,,,2018-01-07,0,0,{}

- the fabric is so soft and smooth like butter, incredibly comfortable as a result
-squat-proof
-the full length is perfect for tall women
-can layer and transition to regular life outfits
-don't show sweat
- the color doesn't fade
Cons:
-pill easily

I bought a pair a couple of months ago and since I was wearing them so much, I decided to treat myself and buy another pair. The only problem is that the inner stitching on the legs doesn't match up and when you try folding them to line it up, it's off. The right leg is an inch or so behind the left leg which drives my OCD self crazy. With Lulu, once you ripe of the inner tag, you can no longer return them. I understand there reasons behind this policy but for $98, they should be perfect.
