Of course everyone will always have their own experience when it comes to these leggings. I am a size 8 in the Aligns. I could even be a 6 if I wanted an even more snug fit.

My hip is around 42"" and my waist is 36-38"".Overall, I thought the fit was perfect! Did it feel snug? Yes, like a real decent pair of workout pants should feel like. For me personally, I need to feel a little compression. I will admit, they did remind me of the aligns in the sense that it was similar to putting on a second skin. But at the same time, enough compression to support me. I hope that makes sense! I got the color nimbus battleship and it is even more gorgeous in person. They are a bit see-through, as they are light-colored pants so I suggest a sold black, white, or neutral color pair of underwear when you wear these. In the picture, it does look cropped.
