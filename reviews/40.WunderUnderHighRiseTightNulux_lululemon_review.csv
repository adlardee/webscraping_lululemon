Even tried them on a stationary bike, thinking they'd stay up in a more seated position. They do not. Chose my normal size. I do not have issues with any other Lulu tights, and I have quite a few... these simply will not stay on.

I read the reviews and had reservations, but I went to the store and talked to one of the girls about the material and fit of the pants. Long story short, she convinced me, and I ordered the pants.
I greatly regret purchasing these. The print is absolutely beautiful but that’s where it stops for me. If I wear them a bit above my hips, the fabric rolls down while I am working out. If I don’t pull them over my hips and wear a bit lower, they sag and tend to ride down while I run (I did run 8 miles, but I expect it to make them to make it through my work out regardless). I also tried to wear them to yoga and same thing, they roll or fall and I found myself adjusting them all the time.
I tried the size I ordered at the store with a pant the girl said was equivalent, but it’s just uncomfortable once I got myself going during my work out.
I really wish I would have bought a different pair of pants with those $90. I own other Lululemon pants and swear by them, so this was a very expensive mistake and lesson for me. Unfortunately, I bought them in clearance so I can’t return.
Beautiful print. At least they will look pretty in my stuff-I-can’t-wear drawer.

I am not sure where Lululemon went wrong with this item, but this pants will not stay up to save my life! I even did not size up based upon the reviews. The top of the band has absolutely no compression and if you move at all they roll under and the top of the pant slides down. I also have never had this type of of fabric and although I really like the ""skin -like"" feel of it, this pant does not have the type of compression that I love my all my other Lulu pants. The reason I buy these expensive clothes if because of the fit and the awesome compression. This item falls short of everything that I love about Lulu. The top of the pants is seriously like a ""slinky"" and just falls right off me. I cannot wear these pants to even run errands in, let alone work out in. I wore them as I taught my Kick Boxing class at the gym and I had my microphone fanny belt tightened so tight, but they still feel down. I must have pulled my pants up about 100 times in class. I had to laugh at them towards the end. Anyways, I love the look and feel of the pants but this are so slippery and will not stay put.

It didn't bother me though because it felt like I was wearing nothing and I bought them. This fabric is a big improvement from the regular naked feel because my pair of Aligns have started to pill with each wash and I only wear them for errands.

It wasn't enough to bug me, but I was pulling them up every few minutes. Otherwise, I didn't feel overheated when I was sweating profusely and they were sweat wicking.
The worst part of these pants is when they are washed. The past three pairs of Lulu leggings I have purchased have had the hemming start to unravel within two washes.

I wore them to a vinyasa yoga class only to find out these pants get extremely baggy and and fall down within 15 minutes. I have been obsessed with lululemon pants for the past 10 years and have never had any issues. These are the worst pants I have ever owned. What a shame to spend all the money for pants that fall down. Apparently other people have had the same issue, I should have read the reviews first before asking for them. I never though this poor of a product would even be sold. Do not buy these pants, and be as embarrassed as I was constantly pulling up my pants in yoga class.",1 out of 5,BUFFAYOGI,NY,YOGI,35-44,ATHLETIC,,print,everything else,2016-12-28,4,2,{}

I typically have a problem with these slipping down so that the 'high rise' is 'normal rise' by the time my workout is over making the crotch hang down too low unless I adjust them frequently. I bought these anyway because of the beautiful feather print. I hadn't tried the nu-lux and I LOVE IT. It reminds me of another brand of yoga pants I enjoy that give a similar naked feel. I don't feel like these are sheer. I wore them to Pilates and got a full view of my rear in the mirror and they were NOT see through. The inside is an off white color, so that is what shows through when the fabric is stretched out. I also thought the seems were really well enforced on this pair of Wunder Unders. I didn't have any straggling threads like I've seen on a few other pairs I've purchased. I'll have to see how they hold up after they've been washed a few times.",4 out of 5,LITTLETXLADY,"DALLAS, TX, USA",SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,ATHLETIC,,,,2016-12-09,1,2,{}

I picked up the plume print. The first time I wore the tight for my yoga practice there was no slippage. The second time I used them for yoga the waistband and crotch slipped down. I had to keep pulling them up. The leg portions did not slip.
I bought this pant in my true to size (size 4). Sizing down created more camel toe and the print became more sheer. I thought I would be fine purchasing nulux fabric in my true to size since I own the nulux fabric in the fast & free tight and the speed wunder tight in a size 4. The fast & free tight and the speed wunder tights stay up while I run and do yoga.

I've had no issues with slippage and will be getting the Plume White Black print as well. Lulu is bankrupting me with this tsunami of gorgeous prints– I've gotta have all of them. They take their place with the other 20 pairs of your pants and crops– plus all my tops that I put to the test in intense workouts.

Unlike previous reviewers, I don't have the constant issue of them sliding down. No matter what I did or how I moved they did not slide a bit. However, as someone mentioned, these pants are kind of sheer but it is because of the pattern. The pattern is made on a white-ish base, so when you pull them up and the fabric stretches, it looks like it's faded. This also happens when you do squats, since the fabric stretches on your knees. I don't mind this but I know that some people do. Although, the iridescent multi black color/pattern is nice and I bought these in that color, I would love to have these pants in solid colors. I'm not particularly a fan of these fancy patterns. About the sizing: these are true to size. I'm in between size 4 and 6 and this time I went with the size 6 because of the ""fading issue"". It is not so relevant if the pants are not overly tight. I mean I could have gone with the size 4 but then these would have looked faded on me even when not stretching.",5 out of 5,INLOVEWITHYOGA,,YOGI,25-34,ATHLETIC,,,,2016-11-30,2,3,{}

They felt great in the store, sadly, once home it was a different story. Wore a pair to go for a walk and could not believe how often I had to stop to pull them up, they want to slide ride off.
On top of the poor construction was the even more disappointing customer service. I tried to exchange them for a different pant and the rep just was very flippant and suggested I had purchased the wrong size.

I got the ""plume white black"" ones, and am disappointed in the Nulux fabric. First, these are on the sheer side...even when putting them on, you can see the black background get lighter and lighter as you tug them up. Not a deal-breaker though, they seemed fine once I got them all the way on. What I really didn't care for was they just wouldn't stay up! I must have pulled them up 20 times during my workout, they kept sliding down. I went from pulling them up as high as I could (hello, camel toe!) to a few minutes later having the crotch hanging an inch below my well, actual crotch. The waist also tended to roll over. I think the fabric is just too slick, it's like it won't grab your skin or something to stay in place. I much prefer the Luon, and now know to stay away from the Nulux!",3 out of 5,CFMAMA,IDAHO,SWEATY GENERALIST,45-54,SOLID,,pattern,fabric,2016-11-30,6,0,{}
