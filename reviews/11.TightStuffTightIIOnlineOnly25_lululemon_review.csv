I like that they have a drawstring, but when I knot the drawstring it is too hard to remove the knot (and I have to remove the knot to be able to get the tights off at the end of my workout, I have a small waist and a booty). So I end up using a safety pin in the drawstring in order to keep the drawstring tight, now this poses a risk to me (I worry about getting poked by the safety pin if it opens up) and the Lululemon drawstring is so thin I worry that by constantly poking a hole through the drawstring that it is going to weaken it. The drawstring issue is where I find Lole tights to be superior to Lululemon, because Lole's drawstring is long enough that I can tighten the drawstring and tie it in a regular bow (so that makes it easy to release at the end of my workout) and the drawstring is long enough that I never have to worry about losing the two ends in the waistband, plus the drawstring is double the width of the Lululemon drawstring so I believe it is more durable and I think the thicker drawstring makes it so the pants stay up better. For the cost of these tights, I just expect them to be better. I prefer Lululemon's pocket placement over Lole's and that's why I occasionally buy and try the Lululemon tights.",1 out of 5,HK20,OHIO,SWEATY GENERALIST,35-44,MUSCULAR,tight,pocket placement zipper pocket,drawstring,2018-12-24,1,1,"{'LL_response_content': ""Hey HK20,\n\n\nThanks for reaching out and providing this feedback for us.

The reflective detail kept calling me back, but I struggled to find a comprehensive review anywhere on these pants. I have about 6 pairs of Pace Rival Crops (old fit and new fit), 2x wonder under in both Luon and Luxtreme, align pant and crops, joggers, studio pants, etc... so I am familiar with Lulu sizing and fit. I wear 10's in all leggings and crops and an 8 in the studio pants for a less baggy fit.. I am 5'7"", 150#, athletic build with stocky legs and large glutes.
These pants are snug, but not worthy of sizing up. If I had ordered a 12 they would look so bad and lose their compression. They are almost too snug in the quad region for me just since I am muscular, and slip slightly, causing the crotch to sit about 1 inch too low. I like the mid rise of the pace rivals and this feels just slightly too low so that it does cut in right at my hips and gives a subtle muffin top. My major complaint is that, although super cute, the scalloped detail hits me like one inch above where my calves end, and I have fairly stocky ankles, so I do get a 'cankle roll' from the constriction down there and there is nothing I can do about that.
Overall, i have worn to gym for a circuit class, did a heavy leg day, 4 mile run, and sprint intervals in these and did have to pull up and adjust the crotch occasionally but no disasters. I would recommend these if you are in love with the look, but BIG QUAD GALS beware that these may be too compressive in that region to sit correctly. I think I would be more apt to order a second pair if the price was closer to that of the pace rivals 88$ or the 118$ of the studio pants, but I will be keeping these and hope the ankle loosens up a bit over time.",4 out of 5,THERAPISTMTGIRL,"HAMILTON, MT",SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,MUSCULAR,second skin,color,tight at ankles,2018-02-14,7,0,{}

I give this pant a five/five stars because this pair of leggings have been my favorite Lululemon purchase thus far. If you like to run and need a pair of smooth, form fitting leggings, these are the pants for you!
Design Details
The Tight Stuff Tight Pant has a medium compression with a comfortable feel, which is great for running both short and long distances. The leggings are a 7/8 length so will stop a 3-7 inches above your ankles, depending on your height. They have a beautiful scalloped bottom that adds feminine detailing. The legging also has reflective details, which is very important for runner’s safety. This pant also includes pockets that are helpful for keys, inhalers, chapstick or anything else you may need for running. This pant is offered in eight colors including shades of black, blue, green, maroon and grey which will offer you a chance to buy a legging that fits your style.
Fit
These leggings will fit all body types extremely well and are super flattering. The fabric is also sweat wicking which means you won’t feel the sensation of sweating while you are running. As stated before, they have a medium compression, which is amazing for any cardio activities. The best part about these leggings is the waistband on the top because it is thick and will form to any body type.
Use
Although I loved these leggings for running, they are also great for yoga, walking, cardio or any type of exercise you may be doing! These leggings are thin and light so if you use then for spin class, you may experience slight pilling because of the friction of the bicycle seat but I have had no issues with pilling. The fabric lives up to it’s expectation and I can promise you satisfaction with these leggings.
Overall, these are the best quality of leggings I have purchased from any store and if you like yoga, running or cardio, you will fall in love with the Tight Stuff Tight II Pant from Lululemon.",5 out of 5,CYCLONERUNNER,MINNESOTA,RUNNER,18-24,LEAN,,,,2017-09-22,12,3,{}

I would rather have NOT had the pocket and had the reinforced seam all the way up, or have the pocket be flush against the lower seam of the waistband.

One store educator had steered me from them as not necessary for my uses but I’m thinking she was reading into her suggestion her own aversion to strong compression. However, when I was exchanging a fast and free 7/8 bottom - those were just two soft and bagging in the crotch for me -- a different store educator suggested I try these. Glad she did. I get a perfect fit in size 2 (confirmed by her and myself; I am 120 and 5’7”, hips size XS, waist measures for S but that rarely means I need to size up). I like a compressive feel anyhow so I guess you should like that sort of fit and be okay with taking time to get them on; not overhard but still. That is the reason I could but I won’t use them for just bike commuting, my daily use, but I will bike in them to the gym, as I have, for conditioning classes. One reviewer mentioned they are roomy in the crotch. I know what she means, there is space but it is not so much that they bag, at least not on me, and I hate that. What that extra room did do was to enable me to do deep squats. At first I wasn’t trusting the pant would give but when I did, I knew what the fit was doing. Ideal. Plenty room to go down but support for the hamstrings, etc. I biked home in them then which has the added benefit of the front leg visibility dots when it’s after sundown.

So I check the reviews online and they were average. After that, I look up videos on how to wash my expensive Lululemon's and I found some very good advice which I'll share with you! I found out that hand washing them with cold water and letting them hang dry is the best way to do it. And to always wash after you sweated in them or else the smell would stay. Also, one of the employees at the store suggested to use fingernail clippers to trim off any thread that is starting to unravel at the seam. Now, the leggings are absolutely amazing! Yes this is too good to be true but it really is the truth! I have done some pretty intense workouts and they've still managed to stay in shape. And they are sooo flattering! Friends have complimented them so much, they've even bought their own pair! The design is really cute too and I love how it reflect at low lighting and they have pockets! Yet the only flaw I have with these leggings is that when I bend over, you can kinda see my underwear...

The Tight Stuff Tight II offers fabulous fit and compression for running and workouts in the weight room. I love the addition of the side pockets for my phone, keys, and kleenex. That was a great revision to the original Tight Stuff Tight. I wear the same size in these tights that I do all other Luxtreme running tights and crops, and they fit great and don't fall down or slide around.
I quickly accrued several pairs of the tights, and unfortunately, the quality issues were quick to surface.
When I pulled my Hero Blue pair out of the wash for the first time, I noticed that the stitching in the waistband had unraveled in the washing machine. I took them to the closest lululemon store, which is 45 minutes from my house, for repair. The store was very accommodating and had them repaired. I was not thrilled with the way the repair looks, but at least I know they won't continue to unravel. The other day, I pulled my black pair out to wear and noticed a similar unraveling issue in the gusset. This pair has been worn and washed three times. Now I have to drive them 45 minutes to the store for repair.
In reading the other customer reviews, I am not the only one who has experienced this problem. Lululemon, this is unacceptable. I would give this a pass if it happened once, but now it has happened twice, and I wonder where the stitching will unravel next. I paid $148 for these tights, and I should be able to wash and wear them without worrying about the integrity of the stitching.",2 out of 5,SUPERK,"OREGON, USA",RUNNER,25-34,ATHLETIC,just right,fit,poor quality,2017-04-18,6,3,"{'LL_response_content': ""Hey SuperK,\nThank you for getting in touch with us today.

Very disappointed and that is a lot of money down the drain",1 out of 5,KATIEDAVIS,"CHARLOTTE, NC, USA",RUNNER,18-24,ATHLETIC,second skin,fit,holes,2016-09-27,4,1,"{'LL_response_content': ""Hey KatieDavis,\nHoly moly.

They are so flattering (I got them in black), skin tight (but doesn't give you muffin top), and the perfect length for my 5""4' frame. I will warn you though, getting them on is a task...but once you get them on, you look 10 pounds lighter. The fabric is my favorite. I am praying that they hold up well with wear and washing, since they are an investment. The scalloped trim and the reflective dots are an added bonus!

Love the compression, can take a few hours to get use to once you get them on. But feel great and exceeded my expectations.",5 out of 5,SARA2016,ONTARIO CANADA,SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,PETITE,second skin,,,2016-09-22,3,0,{}

I tried these pants on a few times when they first came out, and they always felt horrifically and uncomfortably tight. However, I tried the new Tight Stuff II crops recently and they worked like a dream, especially for distance running. Same goes for the new second round of the full Tight Stuff pants. The material is just better, still super compressive with just a little more forgiveness to make them comfortable. (Plus the side pockets are awesome!. ) these are definitely my new go to for running.",5 out of 5,TRAYSEA,OREGON,RUNNER,45-54,ATHLETIC,tight,material,,2016-09-20,9,0,{}

The quality feels great and the added side pockets are a plus! This is a definite improvement form the first version. I can feel a little better spending the money on these versus the older version. Love the graphics and hope to see more in the near future. These feel great on and feel a little thicker then the last. Perfect for Fall/Winter.

I wear them just about daily. And I like the second generation version even better. The side pockets are convenient, and they make the pant more similar to other pants, such as the Pace Rival, at least in terms of style. The Tight Stuff Tight 2 is as wonderfully compressive as the first version, but they feel thicker and softer, so they feel less likely to snag or rip than the first versions, which are kinda delicate.
