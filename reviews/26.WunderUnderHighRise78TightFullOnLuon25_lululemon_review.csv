I'm a Size 4 and usually only buy high-rise leggings, so I know how they're supposed to hold up. These, however, scrunch down and are unflattering unless you're wearing a long shirt to cover it up.

It's also a softer fabric, not the shiny, super tight type. I love these leggings for almost all workouts. I think for running, I would use a different type (maybe that shiny, super tight fabric). They are also great for the leisure part of athleisure. I feel comfortable wearing them while running around before or after my workouts. The length is great, too.

For sizing reference, I wear a size medium/large in most clothing because I'm muscular. I typically purchase a size 6 in Wunder Under Luon fabric, but I'd have to go to a size 4 for the Luxtreme. I also wear a size 4 for the aligns - so the stretchiness definitely plays a role in choosing which size is right for you.
The only fabric I like is Luon, which is unfortunate for me because Luxtreme seems to be the favorite child. I recently purchased the HR Wunder Under in Slate Blue - and I'm slightly disappointed with the color. This seems to be a trend with the Lululemon advertisement photos -- being inconsistent with what the vibrancy is outside of professional lighting. The photos show a pastel blue, and the pant arrived as a dusty blue. It is what it is. Moreover, the fabric has changed once again. I am a huge fan of how grand my butt looks in these workout leggings, but I keep returning for the pair that I bought 2 years ago, not because I want to try all sorts of blends. Almighty Lulu-Gods, why do you keep changing the blends of your cotton fabric without any sort of disclaimer? This legging felt twice as stretchy as a 25"" pant than the HR WU 28"" I purchased in Royal Blue years ago. One is cotton and thick, this one is more polyester than cotton and really thin.
All complaints aside, I refuse to wear any other legging besides Lululemon until I can find one that makes the butt look as good as this does. I also do not have to adjust my leggings constantly. They remain up for the most part. But, I have a tiny waist and a large butt, so there's already some issue there. I have to say though... as obsessed as I am with this brand.

I really like this legging, but it already has some drawbacks that I wouldn't expect from a $100 pair.
For reference I received these around the beginning of December and have worn them multiple times a week for a little over a month now, mostly just to weight lift and do some mild cardio. Have washed according to care directions multiple times as well.
Pros: fits perfectly length wise! I'm 5'3"" and some change and these hit right at the ankle. I love that. I also love the compression on them. They fit like a glove in most areas and they make my legs look hella good. LOVE the high waist and the tummy control. Also, the color is awesome.
Cons: They're already starting to pill up on the inner thigh. I expect this from most if not all my leggings because I got that chub rub going on, but I am disappointed these didn't even hold up for 2 months before pill happened. Second, the crotch area has bagged out a little??? Not sure how or why that happened because they fit perfectly when I first got them, but I put them on the other day and had to double check I hadn't put them on backwards because of the extra room. Weird.
Side note: not sure if it's just the color I got (vintage grape) or the material itself but these show sweat big time! Not a huge deal to me, I don't have a problem with it, but I am surprised these are marketed as a ""training"" legging when they show sweat so easily.

I only wish I would've gone down to a 4. I wear a 6 in most everything lulu except the align pants. I do find myself pulling them up a lot, and the waist seems a little stretched after one wear.
