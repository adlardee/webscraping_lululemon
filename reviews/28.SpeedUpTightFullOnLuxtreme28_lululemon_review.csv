That being said, I was not impressed with this pair of leggings. First, the color (navy blue) is darker in person than the pictures online suggest. More importantly, however, the fit is just not comfortable. I'm 5'6, do a lot of cross training and wear a size 6. Right after the first use I noticed that rather than hugging and complementing your curves (while being flexible at the same time) like other lulu leggings do, these Speed Up Tights, as the name suggests, are tight, but in a 'flattening' sort of way, for lack of better wording (that's to say tight but not in the right places). In addition, they would not stay put. Aside from lacking room in some places they would sort of shimmy down and I found myself having to pull them up from time to time during my workout and readjusting (quite annoying); the waistband drawcord didn't seem to be much help in getting them to stay up. Last but not least, there is also excess material that scrunches up near the knees, which I found pulling down helped but only temporarily.

My one caution is that they stretch out a bit. When I first put them on I thought I'd have to send them back because they were pretty tight but after 2 or 3 gym sessions they stretched out. Because the pants have the drawstring at the waist they work great for me. Other reviews I read said they were too tight in the hips but I did not find that to be the case.
Otherwise I like them enough to spend the money on a second pair. I am a tall lady (5'10"") and I dislike workout pants that end at my calves. These give me good length without bunching up at the ankles.
They are squat proof. I work out with a group of people and asked my friends to examine the booty while I squatted and they deemed the pants squat proof. I use the pants for lifting and light running.
I sweat a lot and I went out on a limb and bought a lighter pair (the greenish bluish color) and although you can somewhat see sweat lines when a workout is really intense it's not an obvious puddle that makes me self conscious.",5 out of 5,TALLSWEATYGAL,,SWEATY GENERALIST,,,,,,2018-08-27,1,1,{}

I take very good care of my clothing and when I wash these Lulus I am not abrasive or use harsh detergent. I'm pretty sure I didn't stretch these out and ruin them either because I am very super petite.
I can say this wasn't the first time this has happened... :( I've noticed that after one wash the fabrics get so thin.... Very very sad. It's to the point that I have to handwash these....

I bought my first pair of these pants in black a little over a year ago. After testing them out for about a couple of weeks I went back and bought a second pair in black because of how much I loved them. I recently bought the burgundy pair when the color was being discontinued and they feel just as great as the black. I have worn these specific pants many times over the year and I have not had any issues with stitching, seams, pilling, or excessive looseness. I wash them in cold water in the washing machine, and hang them to dry like all of my other lulu clothes.
First off, I have to agree that the fit of these pants are a little off compared to other lulu leggings. I am usually a size 6 in the other lulu leggings but I bought these in a size 8, because of how tight they were. I even asked the sales woman and she said that everyone sizes up in this specific pair. I must say that's a little weird that we have to size up for the pants to fit right, but that's really my only issue.
I have used these leggings for running, weight lifting, yoga, and day to day errands and I have never had any problems with them. They feel supportive, are really flattering, feel really nice to the touch, and stay up during my runs when I tie the adjustable waist band. They also easily hold my phone in the side pockets and keys and cards in the back zipper pocket.
I have two pairs in black and one pair in the burgundy and all three pairs are squat proof. My burgundy ones do show some sweat after intense workouts but they dry quickly. I have to say that I have not tried these pants on in any other colors than the black and the burgundy but the ones I have are amazing.

Although, from day one they absolutely WOULDN'T stay up! I wore them for the first time the next day on my run. The entire time I was constantly pulling them up, even with the inside waist band tied. The experience ruined my whole run that I cut it short and ended up walking back home. And since I had worn them I wasn’t able to return them. It was the worst waste of money!
That year I only worn them maybe 15-20 times on short walks, that way I am not pulling them up every minute. And since then have packed them away at the back of my closet. Today I decided to pul them out from the back of my closet to see if it would be a different experience on my run. Nope, they just keep slipping down big time. In the end, I ended up taking the scissors to them and throwing them out.

My initial thought when trying these on in the store was that the material was a lot stiffer and thicker than my wunder unders in the same material. This was not that big of an issue because I know that the two different pants have different purposes. So, I bought these and I only have a few complaints. First of all, the waist length is rather awkward, it's not long enough to pull up comfortably over my stomach while sitting and for a couple times when I had walked for a while, I have noticed chaffing. This was not that big of a deal, because I usually do not walk as much as I did those few times. I usually wear these pants to school, not preferably to lounge in, because of the stiff material and the uncomfortable wait band. Even with the uncomfortable material, it is tight enough so I don't have to worry about my legs looking ""larger.""

I am 5'3"" about 120lbs (thicker through the thighs and booty area), I bought these leggings in the Melanite color the week they came out (about 6 months ago? maybe even a little longer) and they are so soft, comfortable, and snug in all the right places still to this day. I haven't had any issue with the stitches popping/unraveling or anything of the sort. I am usually either a size 4 or 6 in leggings depending on the material, and I decided to go with the 6 in these because they were more comfortable when trying them on (also shoutout to the ladies that work at Lulu because they are always the most helpful and nice people out there, if you ever have a question about fit and are shopping alone, try the item on and ask them what they think!)
Recently, about a month or two ago, I went back and bought these tights in the black, and although the material has been changed slightly, I still love them just as much as the grey pair I have.
I wear these leggings at least 3 times a week each, to the gym/casual outings/etc. I weight lift, do HIIT, and stretch all week in these and they still hold up (no pilling, ripping, or unraveled stitches to complain about here) and still look brand new! I get compliments all the time on these leggings, and have recommended them to a couple friends that also love them just as much as I do. If I had a need for a million pairs of leggings, I have no doubt in my mind that they would all be this style.

I have thicker legs and a larger butt compared the width of my hips. I wear size 2's in American Eagle pants. I bought size 6's after looking at other reviews saying that these leggings were tight. I usually have issues with pant legs being too tight and waists being too loose. I expected these leggings to be tight and not have that issue.
I have had these leggings for two weeks now. In that time, I have worn them three times and washed them once, cold water air dry only. I love them when I'm just hanging out. Best feeling leggings I've ever owned. However, The waist already feels stretched out a bit. I was doing some light jogging today for a scavenger hunt I was doing and I had to pull them up 5 times in 20 minutes. This is fairly aggravating because the reason I wanted them was that I wanted a nice pair of leggings that wouldn't fall down, look see-through, or stretch after every wear. I had a pair of the old Nike pros that I loved when they were in their top condition about 6 years ago. They were just as sturdy as these Lulus and I never experienced sagging.
Because I am used to constantly pulling up my leggings these aren't a major inconvenience, but I am somewhat disappointed. I tried on a pair of leggings in store in both a size 4 and a size 6, and I found the size 6 to be a bit tight, and 4 to be too tight. I thought that this would be good because after wearing them they would stretch a bit. These are advertised as tight so it is unfortunate that that is not how they are.",2 out of 5,MARMS,"BOSTON, MA",SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,ATHLETIC,roomy,tightness around the legs,almost immediate waist stretching,2018-01-26,0,0,"{'LL_response_content': ""Hey MArms,\nThis definitely doesn't sound right.

I am a size 4 in Lululemon. I purchased these in the lovely blue. First impression was, ""holy cow,"" these look tiny. I went back to the webpage to read reviews and figure out if others had that same thought and I should return them. After the mixed reviews I decided to lever myself in them to see how they felt and looked on...if I could get them on properly. With some effort and smoothing they were ok, didn't pinch and moved well.
I decided to try them on my run today. It was 32 degrees when I left and 50 degrees when I finished my 24 miles. No sagging, no chaffing and they were temperate throughout the run. In response to the other reviewers who sized up, I am not sure that is the best plan to take advantage of their compression. It was daunting looking at them and getting them on, but their functionality was spot on in my usual size.

I used to rave about how comfortable, flexible and sweat-wicking the material was, but upon my recent purchase I felt as I was let down by the brand I loved so much.
I purchased these out of the recommendation of one of the associates. I instantly loved how it held in everything, yet provided me with the ease of movement. Unfortunately on only the second time wearing these I found that they started fraying on the back seams. The pants I've had previously have little fray (and I've had them for years!)
Either way i'm extremely disappointed, and with the price tag that this brand has I'd at least would expect the same good quality. I could have easily bought pants elsewhere for a quarter of the price and had better longevity than this pair.

BUT I can't help myself, they have tons of pockets, and on cold days that means I can carry chapstick and tissues, and keep my phone in the pocket instead of having to put it in the pocket of my tank or shirt. They do not slide down while running even though they are mid rise! That's a rarity for me, so that kinda sold me on them since it is nice to just run without having to tug on my clothes.
Details: I'm 5""5"", waist 34"", hips 45.5"" -Curvy but muscular, and most of my weight is in my butt and thighs. The sizing seemed to vary in the colors I bought:
Etch Hail Midnight Navy which I bought on WMTM in size 10 and it was a tiny bit tighter getting on than the radiant multi. Even though they're white inside (LULU!! you gotta stop that) they still look good despite being slightly faded over the front of my thighs. THEY DO NOT PASS THE BEND OVER TEST. I don't care because I bought them for running and maybe will wear for spin classes, but I won't use for bootcamps because they're def not squat proof. Although if you wear a thong no one will probably notice, lol.
Radiant Multi is definitely tighter than Rip Wave Purple Thunder Black which I bought in an 8. The 8 feels the same, maybe a tiny bit more compressive than the radiant multi in size 10, but they don't fade as much over the thighs so I'm keeping them. The Radiant Multi is too light on the inside so it really stretches over the front of my thighs causing fade. But I don't care. I love them too much. I do prefer the way the 8s fit in the Rip Wave Purple ones, and I initially bought an 8 in the Radiant Multi, but I couldn't get them over my thighs.
I'll update if they lose some stars due to quality issues which many other seemed to have had.

The first few times I wore them they were wonderful, but then after washing them twice the stitching began to come out on places in the legs. I also wore them to my gymnastics coaching job and after one practice of sitting on the carpeted floor the butt started to pill, which is very noticeable now. I have heard so many great things about how well Lululemons pants last and I was disappointed that they began showing wear within two wears. Really wish these pants were more sturdy and didn't show wear so early:(",3 out of 5,GYMANDTENNIS,"WISCONSIN, USA",SWEATY GENERALIST,UNDER 18,SLIM,,pockets,seams began to come out,2017-08-15,2,1,"{'LL_response_content': 'Hi gymandtennis,\nI’m sorry to hear about the unravelling seams and pilling you’re experiencing with your Speed Up Tight.

They slim my thighs and make my butt look fantastic. Love the fabric, for some reason the grey ones seemed to be the stretchiest fabric out of the other colors. I tried them on in store and brought them home and the grey color looks great with ALL my workout tops! I was worried about the pockets looking weird, but they don't stand out as much as a thought which I liked. These might end up being my favorite pants!!!",5 out of 5,LAUSPOS,"MINNEAPOLIS, MN, USA",CYCLIST,18-24,CURVY,,,,2017-08-10,5,1,{}

They hold me in and they are GREAT for running. I so far have only had two issues. The first one being I only bought them yesterday and wore them to go on a run and I saw that the threading on the inseam was already coming apart so I cut it off because I already took off the tag so I can't exchange them >.<. The second issue is that they do slide down a lot. It can get annoying when I'm alternating between running and walking on the treadmill, but I do think that they are a great product.",4 out of 5,KAYCEEFL,"BOCA RATON, FL, USA",RUNNER,18-24,SOLID,,the feel,the sliding down,2017-08-09,3,1,"{'LL_response_content': ""Hi KayceeFL,\nSorry to hear that you're experiencing some issues with your Speed Up Tight.

They were tight in all the right places, made my butt look GREAT, and held up very well. I was so excited to get my second pair, due to all the constant wear of my old ones, and I purchased these. I expected the same fit and feel as the last pair as they were both speed tights, and I was excited about the mesh detail, but they got saggy very quickly, and immediately pilled around the crotch and inner thighs. I still wear them, as they are comfortable, and I love all my other lululemon, but this pair was disappointing.",3 out of 5,OSKILOVESSWEAT,"BERKELEY, CA, USA",RUNNER,18-24,ATHLETIC,,,,2017-08-03,7,4,"{'LL_response_content': ""Hey oskilovessweat,\nThanks for reaching out today.
