Also - NOT my favorite.,"I was tempted to buy In Movement leggings a few times, but ended up returning them. I like the feel of this fabric which reminds me of buttery-soft Nulu. However, these fabrics have less compression compare to Luxtreme or Nulux. I prefer more compression in my workout pants, so I buy my leggings mostly made with these types of fabric. When I say Workout Pants, I don't mean yoga. This is about high intensity activity - with lots of jumps & cardio. I believe the In Movement tight would be great for cycling, yoga and weight-lifting. I do these activities as well, so I kept two pairs In Movement crops (I'm 5'4"", 122lbs, size 4 in these). But those are not my favorite, just OK.

I didn't. But it looked like I did. And this was in the dark olive color. I wore this to a pilates reformer class, not even a high intensity class. I was beyond mortified. I've never experienced this in other LLL olive pants (at least not this crazy level).
On top of this issue the pants just won't stay up. No matter how many times during the hour long class I tugged and pulled (I'm guessing close to 30..) they just roll over.

I run everyday, so having a pant I know will withhold a 10 mile run is a must! I bought my first pair about a month and a half ago in a size 8 (regular jean size) and they fit just like a glove. Within a few wears they stretched out to what seemed like a size 10, so I exchanged them for a size 6. Again, after a few wears they have stretched out to what seems like a size 10. I always wear a size 4 in aligns (as they say to) so I am kinda questionable about sizing down to a 4 in running pants! These pants are so big on my waist that I don't think I wouldn't have a problem getting the 4 on tbh.
I have yet to try the fast and free because these ""in movement"" ones, are just like thick aligns (basically perfection), yet Im thinking I might have to after having some problems.
If I were you, size down 2 SIZES. Yes this might sound crazy but trust me. It may be stiff and super tight at first, but after a few cardio sessions, they will be fine. These are the ""running version"" of the aligns 100% so sizing down twice wouldn't hurt.

After literally 10 minutes of wear, I can see that these pants are no different. Everyone complains about the pilling from Lululemon, but to me, the dust/lint collecting is a bigger issue. It makes the pants look old after one wear. For what these leggings cost, I expected so much more.
I can also see why people say they can't stop pulling them up. It's because the crotch/bum area is made for very long torsos, so the crotch ends up sitting low on the average woman (I'm 5'7 and the crotch was low on me - I also sized down per reviews). They also fit strangely, compressing your bum, which make them look unflattering.
I am really sad to see the quality of Lulu leggings go downhill. I have several Lulu pieces from nearly 10 years ago that look almost brand new, including leggings, but all of the purchases I've made in the last 3-4 years have not held up the same way.

After narrowing down the best legging brands to 5 companies, I ended up choosing in-movement by Lululemon!
I'm not sure what's not to love. They are incredibly comfortable & I love the thick (& high) waistband! The only reason I almost didn't purchase them is because I wanted leggings that could hold my phone - only to find out that THESE DO. They have a pocket in the back that can easily hold my iphone 7 (it's a fairly large phone!), which I love.
The only thing I would note about these pants is that you may want to size down. I've been wearing them non-stop for a few days & they are starting to be just a tiny bit loose, but this issue is easily fixed if you size down. Easy peasy. These pants are still amazing (even if you don't choose to size down) & are exactly what I was looking for.

I fell in love with them at the store after an employee suggested them for my hot yoga classes. I usually dislike the way I look in leggings and do not feel confident walking around wearing them, but these ones make me feel hugged in all the right places and I absolutely loved wearing them to my hot yoga. HOWEVER... I washed them inside out in a cold cycle with ONLY other lululemon clothes (with same cleaning instructions), cleaned with soap nuts (so very gentle natural soap) and hung it up to dry. Once I turned it back inside in, some of the seams were frayed and coming out and a bit of pilling had started on top of them. I cannot believe I paid this ridiculously high price (125$ with tax) for something that doesn't look high quality after only one wash. It's so annoying because I LOVE these pants. Also something super annoying is that it picks up the tiniest little lint of fabric so I constantly have lots of white lints all over the pants even after washing it.
I hesitated on buying these since a few years back I bought some black wunderunder pants and they pilled like crazy and looked horrible after only a couple of months (I had paid over 100$ too...) and I thought Lululemon was overhyped and just a trendy brand. But after seeing all the yogis in my class wearing lululemon, I thought I'd give it a second chance. Now I've gotten my confirmation that these are not only not ethically made (I haven't found any transparent information on how their products are made, who makes them, where, do they get a fair wage?) but I think they are FAR overpriced. At this price, they should look like new for at least 5 years. I cannot believe I spent so much money on these.

I've exercised all my life, but mostly aerobic types of activities so crossfit is tough. I have 3 core injuries: 1) an old compression fracture in my back 2) diastasis recti from 3 pregnancies with large babies and 3) a rib that slips out of place (rarely but extremely painful). To say the least, I need a lot of core support to continue doing the things I love. I'm so happy to have found these high waisted leggings. They support my abdominal muscles and back while keeping my rib in place. They give a smooth sleek look so I don't have to worry about a lumpy stomach look under my fitted tank top. They also have great flexibility in the knee which is helpful for the various lifting movements. The only drawback is the limited colors. I would prefer darker colors and patterns to hide sweat in unsightly areas. As of now, I'm limited to black and navy blue.

For these I got a 6 - they are nice and fitted but not too tight to where I am uncomfortable. I wear them for running and have had no issues with them sliding down or not holding their shape. The pocket in the back fits my phone which I really appreciate.

I've worn Lululemon for the last 8 years of my life, and I can agree with everyone here that the quality has gone down.

It's only now after 5-8 years of wearing them that the stitches are starting to unwind itself. It seems totally reasonable, and I think I got my wear out of all of them.
I went into Lululemon, and with the help of an associate I purchased this. The associate recommended this for every day wear and I thought they were great. The material wasn't too thin and it seemed durable. Every time I washed it (ONLY two hand washes), my tub was filled with black-ish water.

I didn't even know that they were a size 4 until I asked the sales woman if they should be a challenge to get on and if she thought the pair I had on were too snug. Her response to me was ""we always say the workout begins with trying to put your pants on"". Not sure if the smaller size was right I went ahead and grabbed a 6 and found that the size 4 felt better and more secure. So I bought the 4 and put them to the test in my Crossfit workouts. Through jumping rope, squatting, running, and climbing ropes these pants have been AMAZING!! They completely stay in place and don't stretch out over the hours I wear them. So many of my other Lulu pants are size 8's and I'm constantly pulling them up during workouts. And now I know that they are falling down because they are the wrong size!!! I've been reluctant to get my pants too snug because I'm always afraid that if they are too tight the seams will begin to pull out. But now I feel like I've had the a-ha moment like all those ladies had when Oprah told them they were wearing the wrong bra size! I've been wearing the wrong size of pants and I have a whole drawer full of pants that feel terrible to wear after knowing what the right size of pant feels like during a workout!!!
I've noticed a lot of people giving these pants a lower rating because they feel like they stretch out during a workout. I think you have to get a size smaller than normal in these pants and if you do you will love them.

But I still buy, wear and enjoy the brand because no other gives me the fit and fuction that lulu does even so.
I love these pants. The big test for me is when i don’t remember or want to take them off when i get home. They feel that good. I’ve used mine for spin, kettlebell, yoga, biking around, trapeze. I went from spin to the weight room feeling dry which is pretty amazing. For yoga they perform and feel like the awesome aligns but with more compression in the waist/belly area (and of course, more versatility). I take off one star because i feel the need to snug them into my crotch or else they will bag a bit there, but once adjusted pretty much stay put. i never ever feel they fall or move at all from my waist which almost any other bottom will do in trapeze.
On one quality note, I have in 8 years of buying Lulu and really beating it up bicycle commuting, i have never had seams fall apart. Not sure what is up with that with other customers but never an issue for me and not in these pants. I started wearing Lulu bottoms in 4 and shifted to size 2 at some point, under advisement.

Before purchasing, I've tried all of the styles that I don't own and decided on this based on educators' recommendation and feel. I genuinely loved this at first.

I tried them on before purchasing and went with my normal size 8, but I wish I would have sized down in these. I absolutely love the feel of the fabric and the light compression. After wearing these a couple of times, the fit started feeling funky. They seemed stretched out and I am CONSTANTLY pulling them up. So even though I purchased them to practice hot yoga I don't wear them... it's so annoying to be constantly adjusting your pants when you're trying to focus on your flow. I think a smaller size would have worked better in the long run. I wore them recently to teach vs. practice, but still have the same problem with having to pull them up. My ""In Movement"" pants keep moving where I don't want them to move instead of staying put and moving with me.

I was in between sizes in this style (I normally wear a 4 in most leggings (Aligns, Wunder Unders, Fast and Free etc.) but occasionally a 6 in things like the Train Times) - my normal size 4 was a little uncomfortable around my butt with the stitching so I sized up to a 6 which fits okay, a little big but I had no choice as I didn't want to be uncomfortable. Now I am thinking maybe I should have stuck it out because after my first workout in these I am done with them. They really stretched out throughout the day wearing them but ESPECIALLY once I started sweating in my gym session at night. They are a slick feel inside the pant and they kind of just slid down my body the more I moved.
These just may not be the right cut for me for a legging. Really sad about it as I have over 40 pairs of Lululemon leggings and this is one of a handful that just isn't working for me. I don't feel like I should have to buy a pair and be uncomfortable until they stretch out which is why I sized up but the waist is so big on these and they aren't as stretchy as some of the other fabrics. Also with the back slit pocket I have a lot of extra material in the waist in the back. I just have a larger butt and hip area in comparison to my waist. Not sure if it's the material or the cut that doesn't work for me but any ladies with a similar body type (bigger butt/hips/thighs) may find they have this same issue.
On a positive note...they don't feel like they will pill - or if they do it won't be for many wears.

First, I would definitely size down if you are between two sizes - I am either a 6 or 8 in everything lululemon, and wear a 6 in anything nulu/nulux (aligns, WUs and fast & frees); I'm an 8 in anything full-on luxtreme (train times, speed up tight, etc). I've tried these on in store in both 6 and 8,
and the 6 is definitely a better fit, especially since there's no drawstring to tighten the waist. I'm 5'6, 150lbs, waist 28"" and hips 38"" so I do have a small waist compared to my hips. The In Movement tight in size 6 perfectly hugs my waist and my muscular calves & thighs, and the length is just right. I've worn these for HIIT where I'm jumping all around and then for weight lifting and they are PERFECT, do not budge and the sweat-wicking capability is awesome. I spilled water all over them and it dried within minutes! I love the Everlux material and find it way superior to the Nulux. Please make more tights in Everlux!!! Anyway, the stitching has held up so far but I've just hand washed them and hung to dry a few times, so I'll keep an eye out for any quality issues there. LAST BUT NOT LEAST: Sheerness. We all hate leggings that are sheer/don't pass the squat test, right? Well - I tried these on in ""nocturnal teal"" and black in the store, and BOTH were sheer on the booty in a full squat in a size 6. When I sized up to an 8 they were less sheer but the waist was loose and I knew they would stretch out quickly. I took the chance and ordered them in nile blue and the dark red shade online, and both of those are NOT sheer at all in a full squat. My suspicion is the darker colors are more prone to sheerness on a full booty (lol) so just take that as a warning if you like a snug fit & have a slightly larger than average behind. Oh I also picked up the black & white chirasu print in store recently and they are great too! The print does look a little stretched out over my curvier areas but not in a very obvious way, and they are not see through in a full squat either.

I’m a college student and I bought them to wear around campus and for group fitness classes. This is my second pair of Lulu leggings; the first being a black pair with side pockets. I am 5’3” with an athletic build, and I wear size 6 jeans in several brands. Lululemon’s size 6 has proven to be accurate for my body. I am also pleased with the pant length. Usually I find myself cuffing my jeans, but I don’t like to do so with athletic pants. These leggings hit right above my ankle bone which I find stylish, preferable, and most importantly-unnecessary to cuff.
As previously discussed, I enjoy taking group fitness classes and these leggings are a great addition to my workout collection. So far I have only worn them in the winter and while they wouldn’t be considered as winter attire by themselves, I can walk to my fitness and academic classes while still being reasonably comfortable. Normally I prefer to wear shorts while working out, but I have found them to be breathable enough that I can get through class while maintaining a comfortable temperature. I have only worked out in them once, but they did a satisfactory job of wicking away sweat considering how damp indoor group fitness classes get.
Also, as far as comfortable on-campus attire, these are the softest pair of leggings I own, even when compared to other reputable brands such as Victoria Secret, Nike, and Under Armour. This brand of leggings also keeps their shape after continuous wear, while still being extremely flexible. Nothing is more annoying than constantly having to pull up your leggings throughout the day. So far this has not been a problem.
In regards to durability, as mentioned before, I was very content with the black pair I had previously purchased. Even after numerous wears and washes in the last year, the black has stayed at its darkest shade and the stitching has held up. Speaking of color, the “mystic green” in the photo of the pair I most recently purchased is extremely accurate to the real color. I find it to be a very attractive neutral shade, which is great if you are looking for a pair of leggings that you can match with several tops.
I’ve only had this new pair of leggings for a month, but I anticipate this pair also holding up. Although they are a higher-end legging, I consider them to be a worthy investment and as well as a wardrobe staple.

I've owned these since December. I wear them for hanging out sometimes (because they're SO comfy), but I also put them to work -- lots of high intensity indoor cycling. I sweat heavily, and surprisingly they do a nice job of keeping that relatively hidden. And they've held up incredibly well so far.

"In Movement 7/8 Tight Everlux 25""",https://shop.lululemon.com/p/women-pants/In-Movement-78-Tight/_/prod8760192?color=0001,3.3 out of 5,30,Pills But Feels Amazing,"I'm divided on these ones - I was initially intrigued because of how good they looked on a store employee - she gushed about how they wouldn't pill because they were made with a combination of the Luxtreme and Luon material - a new material called Everlux. I tried them on and was blown away by the fit and feel, but they also pill over time and the fabric catches lint like no other.
Three pairs later, here are my thoughts about them.
THE GOOD:
- VERY comfortable.
- Very little stretching out - you can wear these for days and they'll feel like new every time.
- Flattering fit and high rise hugs just enough.
- Great for lifting, running, you name it - they'll stay up and work with you.
THE BAD:
- I know I just said the high rise is good but these have nothing on the compression of the Fast & Frees or Wunder Unders. I feel like with the Wunder Under my tummy pouch just disappears. Not the case with the In Movements, they definitely show a little tummy, not a bad thing but doesn't feel as secure.
- They pill pretty much immediately. I took them on a walk around the city and came home with pilling on the inside of my thighs. Minimal usage - quick pilling.
- The WORST thing about these is that they catch onto ANY LINT in your closet/whatever you sit on when you go out. They end up looking a little old and fuzzy because of this. I recommend storing them inside out so that they don't collect dust over time.
- When I workout in these my legs get HOT. There's no breathability whatsoever.
So in conclusion I think I just got really over hyped by how they felt and jumped the gun on buying a third pair. I bought two initially in my excitement but I think overall I would stick to buying something else in the future. They're definitely very comfortable but they don't feel like they will last and the flattering fit doesn't look so flattering when there's all this lint on my leg. I'll wear out what I have for now but the cons outweigh the pros for me right now.

AGAIN?!??,"I became ill earlier this year in which I could no longer be active, thus putting on enough weight to no longer be able to squeeze myself in to my size 6 LLL collection. As I began to be able to walk again, I decided to purchase a couple of pairs of LLL pants in my new size (8-10), the In Movement Tight being one of them. I was excited to find something comfortable (Everlux feels great on), in a dark color & not black (Nocturnal Teal!) & not too cottony feeling (like Luon). (The other pants purchased were made of Luxtreme but had to return them as they were slipping down terribly).
I took a size 8 in the In Movement Tight & thought they were the right size. I have worn them all of four times. Despite the comfort level, they are not pleasant to wear since they need constant hiking up (they also pool at the ankles, a first for me). My husband kept asking me what my problem was with my pants. They appear to have stretched out, incomprehensibly! I don't even want to wear them as (very expensive) house-pants due to the never ending slippage.
Maybe some will find this style & fabric to work for them but sadly, I do not.

I have three colors: black, nocturnal teal, and black cherry. None are see-through. I noticed the black cherry waist seam seems pretty stiff, so as I was pulling them over my hips I could hear some ripping of the seams. I hope this doesnt lead to holes or the waist unraveling. Maybe lululemon could add reinforced stitching in this area with a stretchier waistband. My favorite tights from lululemon are the High Times in the full on luon fabric. However, with the type of workouts I do, I find that the fabric can feel a bit scratchy when my legs rub together. I have other tights, made of luxtreme, and nulu which are fine, but I'm not crazy about the shine those fabrics have. The everlux fabric of these tights are super soft, don't feel scratchy at all and don't have very little sheen. My workouts consist of cardio, high intensity, and strength training. I found them to feel quite comfortable and cool. I have worn my black pair a few times already and washed them. I haven't noticed any piling, but I have had lots of luck with my lululemon tights and have never had issues with piling (only wash with other workout fabrics/and air dry only). People mentioned that they found the fabric feeling like it stretches out after wear, which they do feel a bit ""saggy"" after initial wear, but they don't look saggy at all. As far as the tights attracting lint, I noticed it too, but it's not that bad in my opinion. Overall I'm very happy with these tights and look forward to purchasing even more colors!",4 out of 5,NINAT,CALIFORNIA,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,ATHLETIC,,fabric,stiff seam as wait.,2017-11-01,3,0,{}

These sounded perfect. However, I ignored the remaining, negative reviews:
1. Attracts lint. I accept, as a pet owner, I need to lint-roll my clothing. However, none of my previous Lulu purchases required as much brush action as these pants. And, like prior reviews, not all the lint came off!
2. Not a high rise. I love my lulu high rise pants, especially for yoga. However, these are not a high-rise (unless you want camel toes).
3. Sizing. I wear a 4-6, depending on the material. I went with the 6 in these based on reviews about poor rear coverage during gym workouts. After one use: snag in a seam and stretched waist. So my rear is covered but my leggings don't fit properly.
Prior to wearing (1x) I considered returning as I was not ""in love"" with the color I selected. Should have gone with my gut and returned for a style I know and like. Tags removed = Worst $98 purchase.

Maybe if these were in a print it wouldn't have been so bad, but they definitely didn't wick sweat like the ed said they would (no fault of her own, it's in the description). I waited an hour to change at home to see if they would eventually dry and they somewhat did... but really?

I like the fit and style - can't you just make a luxtreme or fullux pant like this and call it a day?
Everlux as a material has a nice hand-feel, but it doesn't seem to be high quality or long-wearing. The pair I received has comically bad stitching on a seam right at center back below the logo - poor quality control. As I commented on another review below, it was like they were actively sucking ambient lint and dust out of the room. Pants that attract this much lint from nowhere from three minutes of wearing are going to look terrible in no time and will likely pill quickly and easily. The waistband in my regular size is too big and sags and wrinkles around my waist - lame - and I think sizing down might make these less than opaque. The Everlux feels nice on and looks flattering but isn't compressive. These don't seem like a good choice for technical anything. The garnet color is totally underwhelming in person. I will likely return these due to the above issues so won't have a chance to try them for an actual workout, but even assuming these hold up for actual fitness endeavors, it seems like they would show sweat very easily based on the material.",2 out of 5,LOIRASAFADA,"NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, CA, USA",SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,ATHLETIC,,fit,,2017-10-01,1,1,{}
