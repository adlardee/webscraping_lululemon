Here's why - Lululemon must know that many of their customers shorten their tights (that's why alterations are so easy and free, right?). Well, if I got these altered, I'd lose the S and the O in Soulcycle and the O and the N in Lululemon - the letters go all the way down to the bottom of the tight, so any shortening makes you lose the letters!
