These were my first Luxtreme legging I purchased, so I am not sure if there are any differences between full on Luxtreme WU legging and Engineered Full-On Luxtreme, but I LOVE the fabric of these pants. Yes, it feels a little tighter than Luon, but it is not too tight. Lextreme fabric is smoother than Luon, so I think it has to be a little tighter to stay up?? I normally wear a size 6 in Luon leggings, and went with the same size in Lextreme. I tired a size 8 as well. They felt OK, but I knew they will not stay up in running. I am glad I went with my regular Luon size. I run 40-45 minutes in these, and they stay up. Love the pattern, feel, quality, and everything about the pants that I bought another Engineered Full-On Luxtreme WU in ""Painted Paisley Wunder Under Silver Ice Black"" in January.

I do feel the material is a bit thinner then my other Full On Luxtreme pants but because of the print you can't notice.
Only downfall is the length but I am 5'2 and expected this (plus Lulu offers free hemming).",5 out of 5,PHOENIXM,BC,,25-34,MUSCULAR,,print,length,2018-12-05,10,0,{}
