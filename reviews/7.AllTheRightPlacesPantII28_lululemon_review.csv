Training - My training includes mostly crossfit type exercise, as well as spin classes. These pants do NOT stay as well in place as WU's. The silky smooth fabric tends to slip down lower during training, so it's up to you to hike it back up in place.

I have always had an eye for the brand but I never actually purchased any of their products until this last December. I always thought they were super cute and flattering, but EXTREMELY expensive for my college student budget. Well, I saved up my money and went out and bought my first pair of All the Right Places Pant. I liked what the lady at the store had to say about them, and I especially loved the idea of the pant design that made a camel-toe avoidable. After the first couple of weeks I noticed that the pants had stretched out, but I was told by the lady at the store they hold their stretchiness. I got over the fact that they weren't as stretchy anymore, but then I began noticing how easy it was to snag the pants on anything no matter how hard I tried keeping care of them. Since I spent so much on them I wanted to make sure they looked like new every time I wore them. After trying to get over the pulls, I noticed the other day that now my pants have a hole in the pocket where my id card fits, I only noticed because the card is white.

The lines on these pants are amazing. I've looked high and low, and there's nothing like them anywhere. So this is how I justified my purchase. However, I see what people mean about the stretching. For me, it's happening in the waist/just under the butt. I think it's a combination of the fabric being flimsy and the fact there's no middle seam in the front. It seems like the thigh seams (which MAKE these pants) actually contribute to pulling the waist down (the seams are stiffer/hug the thighs, while the whole front of the waistband doesn't really have seams and so can be tugged down by the thigh seams).
That being said, here is my take. I ordered my regular size and worked out in them. Yes, I was tugging them up. Yes, there is a little gap at the top of the waist. No, I don't feel super compressed in these pants. But they still look great and move freely with me. As a comfy/everyday pant, I don't mind tugging them up now and then because of how awesome they make me feel and look. As a workout pant, I'm not a huge fan. So I'm wearing them to hang out/run errands, which basically means I'll wear them all weekend and every night after work. More than I wear my workout pants, so I'm not upset.
As for sizing down, I felt a lot more compressed in the size down. I didn't notice any major differences in coverage--these pants passed my squat test in my regular size and in the size down. But I will say my movement felt more restricted. If you want to feel compressed, you might like sizing down. I personally felt a little like a stuffed sausage and noticed the V at the top of my legs was much more pronounced in the smaller pants. I imagine if I wore them for a long time, they might feel a little itchy, that's how tight they were. It wasn't that the smaller size was wrong, per say. Just a different fit, and probably more solid for working out. But I am glad I stuck with my regular size. They are not as fitted as many of my other pants, but so what. They look awesome.
As for the quality, I am keeping an eye out because of all the complaints I have seen. But I did wash these once so far and haven't noticed any pilling or any seams coming undone. Let's just say I am cautiously optimistic. Overall, I would say if you really like the look of these pants, give them a shot. I've been back to the store a couple times trying to decide whether to get a smaller size or whether to go with a different style, and I'm sticking with these in my regular size, hoping for the best.",4 out of 5,MRAE,,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,SLIM,,cut color details,waistband just a little too stretchy,2018-01-27,5,0,{}

I wanted to like them so bad. I have some full-on luon wunder unders that I love and wear constantly. They are size 10, I am about 6'1"" and they fit me perfectly, even through about a year of washing and drying and working out in them, they have never lost their shape or tightness, and their material has never lost its durability.
I wanted a new pair so I would have some other leggings to rotate out, and I figured I'd try a new style. The lines and shape of these leggings seemed like they would look good on my long legs. I read through the reviews on these leggings for multiple days, trying to decide whether to listen to the few positive ones, or the many abundant negative reviews. Being the person that I am, always trying to be positive despite the obvious logical decision, I went against my best judgement and decided to order a pair. Despite the reviews saying to order a size down for when the leggings lose their tightness, I ordered true to size (a 10), and thank God I did because these things are SO. FREAKING. THIN. If I had ordered a size smaller, I think they would have ripped.
I loved the line accents and the intended style/shape of the leggings, but I kid you not, you could see STRAIGHT through every inch of them. And I'm not talking about the little squat test you do to see if you can see your underwear when you bend over, like I could stand straight up with no tension in the leggings at all and you could see every little freckle on my thighs and every minor dimple in my backside. Like these things left nothing to the imagination. The material is AWFUL. So thin, so flimsy, I can't even imagine trying to run, do squats, lift weights, do yoga, or do literally anything in these. I could see exactly why everyone said the seams were falling apart and the leggings weren't staying up after just one wash. These things are more flimsy than the $15 pair of leggings I bought from target the other day, and these are $130...
I am extremely disappointed, and really wish I would've listened to all the negative reviews instead of hoping that somehow they would magically work for me when they didn't work for 95% of the other people that have bought them! If you're reading this, please take my advice (or keep scrolling and read the advice of countless others) and save your money!

First and foremost, my cellphone fits perfectly in the side pocket and stays put no matter what activity I am doing. The snug fit and high waist holds you in without feeling constricted. I wear them constantly both for bootcamp and casually and they are holding up beautifully (I always line dry them).
I have been in the habit of checking to see if they offer new colors and lately, I noticed they weren't available online, at my local store, or at a store on Broadway Ave in NY where I was visiting. I'll admit feeling more bothered than I should have about not being able to buy any more of this style of pant. I am very happy to see them available online again; albeit in only 2 colors.

I'm 5'5'' around 117 lbs (I wear a size 4), I go to the gym around 3-4 times a week usually to run. I have a thigh gap so I don't normally see any pilling on my leggings and I'm fairly particular about avoiding materials that are likely to pill. After owning several pairs, I'm fairly familiar with the care instructions so I've never experienced any other issues with my Lulus. I've always told my friends that Lulus are great quality and they last forever so they're worth every penny. But I purchased this pair in stores around early May, I've worn it 5-6 times and have washed it 3 times, by the second time I washed it I noticed pilling on the outer thigh area and at first I thought maybe it was a little blemish I didn't notice when I first bought the leggings but by the 3rd time I washed the leggings the pilling got a lot worse.
I was extremely disappointed, I've never had any of my Lulus pill and I've had some for years...I used to be able to recommend Lulus to my friends with complete confidence but after this experience I'm not so sure. I hope Lulus can go back to is original quality soon.",2 out of 5,ERICA0213,"CALIFORNIA, USA",RUNNER,18-24,LEAN,,,excessive pilling,2017-07-18,2,0,"{'LL_response_content': 'Hey Erica0213,\nThanks so much for sharing your thoughts today.

However, before I tell what's wrong, let me just say that I really do love these pants. The fit, the feel, the look - all of it is so nice and so unique. I was a head on Wunder Under buyer until I put these pants on and fell in love.
And it's because I loved them so much that I ignored the fact they were really not up to par with the price I paid. In the first week that I bought these, the seams stripped right along the inner thigh -where Lululemon pants usually do. I live far from my Lululemon store so I ignored this issue and tried to not let it get in the way of me loving the pair because the drive would have been so far to get them fixed. Then, they started to sag on my runs and I'd be forcing the pants to just stay on my dang hips with every skip.
I have a handful of Lululemon product and so I understand that the pants you buy are not meant to be impervious and require a certain amount of care for upkeep. I spend a good amount of money here so I do well to follow all these procedures to get the most life out of my ""100$ work-out pants"", that no one else can seem to know why I bought.

The All the Right Places II was hands down a better fit and feel for yoga and I have found they can do it all including running and the pockets are great for taking your phone along but they lay flat when not needed. The Tight Stuff is designed for run and is far too compressive for doing yoga.
I got a 6 which equates to a men's small and after many sweaty yoga sessions and quite a few miles I have had no seem or stretching out issues as others have reported. The lack of a front seam is also a plus for guys and keeps the pants discreet.

I called and spoke with customer service, and let her know what I was looking for and what other Lulu products I owned already ( Groove Pants and Dance Studio Pants) She recommended the All the Right Places Pants to get the fit and feel I was looking for and suggested the same sizing as my groove and DSP pants.

No tired legs or butt here after a hard run or heavy squats. I was concerned about the seaming based on reading others reviews, however I have not had an issue with any of the seam coming apart after wearing them for 6 workouts and 5 washes.

I have a pair of black version I and the luxtreme is thick and they stay put...good seam, etc. So, I expected the same with a different color. Just wore them for the first time Tuesday for a gym session and when I put them on, I noticed right away that the luxtreme is much, much thinner and not compressive/supportive. Also, usually, I have to maneuver my Lulu tights to get them over my feet, but this pair pulled on too easily, and were baggy at the ankles! What in the world?? I was already at the gym with no extra pants, so I had to give them a try. My entire workout, I was pulling them up (I got my usual size 4), which was really distracting. The top rolled down, and in general I was just annoyed. Washed them in the sink with Woolite (cold water) last night and hung to dry. When I went to the drying rack, I noticed that they had a thread at the bottom of the leg that is frayed and coming undone and that the material is frayed like just wearing them this one time ruined the pants at the bottom of the legs. For $135, this is not acceptable. Now I have two pairs of $128 (plus tax) pants (Goal Crushers also) that have fraying and loose threads.

I was able to exchange these for one of the 2 speed tights I further picked up. I am a size 2 (118 and 5'7"").

But Disapointed,"I am very conflicted about these pants. I received the exact ones on sale as a gift from my husband (pink, full length). I have actually been wanting the All the Right Places pants for a while, so I was stoked that he got them on discount. Ultimately, I love the fit. That's why I fell in love in the first place. The waistband is high but sits comfortably, the side pockets are a dream, and I can even get on board with the bright pink color. It's fun.
However, there are 2 things that would cause me to tell a friend to ""think twice"" before buying these. One, I have washed these once (as directed by the instructions also), and some of the seams are already fraying. I have 3 pants from lulu, and another pair did this as well. I thought it was a fluke, but it's happening again. Secondly, these tend to lean on the see through side.... Basically, I will not be wearing these on any sort of leg day, or a day where squats/lunges/deadlifts, etc are involved. It's not terrible, but any sort of underwear (or lack thereof...) is noticeable in the crotch area of the pants. The back is fine until you bend down (hence, not using them on leg day). The knee is a bit see through but who really cares about the knee I guess.
I like these pants a lot, but I wouldn't purchase again. It just seems like too much money to invest in a pair of pants that frays after 1 wash and are see-through.

These pants were recommended to me in the store and after trying them on, I was immediately sold. The sales rep said that they're perfect for Crossfit activities and I'd have to agree, just based on the way they fit. They're tighter in areas that need extra compression, which I love, and the high rise waist gives you perfect lines. These pants, without a doubt, make your body feel and look ROCKIN. No joke, they're everything you've ever wanted and more in a pair of Lulus.
Why are they a tease?
Because the thread quality of these pants is terrible. I cannot express how disappointed I am with whoever chose the thread for these pants. And I'm also really disappointed in this person's coworkers for not stopping this embarrassing train wreck. I wore my first pair to one Crossfit workout, and I'll add that it was considerably moderate...I wasn't doing rope climbs or flipping tires. After the workout, the entire back seam had unraveled a single thread all the way up. Disappointed, but understanding that every once in awhile there's going to be a bad apple. I took them back to the store, where they swapped out another pair no problem. I cut the tags off this morning, wore them to the store, and noticed that the mediocre threading has failed yet again. This time, on the hip. I've called the store and requested that they hold another pair for me seeing that I'll be coming to make another swap.
What started as a GEM, has proven to be a complete tease and a slap in the face for those of us who purchase Lulu clothing on a monthly basis.
Stop sewing cotton (or anything related to cotton) thread on Lycra fabric Lulu, it's a shady way of cutting corners and if it weren't for your stellar customer service team, you guys would literally be in trouble.

Some of the stitching starting coming undone and even more had started unraveling on the upper thigh. I'm so disappointed because they fit really well. But to only have worn them to work for one day without even working out in them and to see that happening I'm really disappointed with the amount of money I spent on them.

WOW. I think I'm in love with a pair of pants. These pants do serious wonders for your thighs and butt. They definitely hold everything in and are just high enough waisted.

I have a pair of the All the Right Places Pant from several months ago (still in great shape btw). These are, I think, identical except for the flip-up reflective strip on the ankles, which is a great addition.
The Hero Blue color is so gorgeous, rich and opaque. They're a nice change from my usual black. They do show sweat a bit, but that happens to all of my pants, so it's not a defect IMO. Please keep Hero Blue around!
I'm 5'7"" 160lb, 36-26-40, and my usual size 8 was perfect for these pants. The seaming is so attractive and creates beautiful lines down the legs. The waist is the perfect rise, and I love the smooth front.
I highly recommend these pants for a sweaty yoga practice. I practice Ashtanga, and I much prefer the Luxtreme of these and other pants to Luon for sweat-wicking purposes.",5 out of 5,BADGERGIRLINIL,,YOGI,25-34,CURVY,,,,2016-03-06,2,0,{}

I loved these pants for about month...until the seam in the crotch began to rip. I only wore them maybe once or twice a week because they were compression, so I expected them to last a good deal longer than they did. I swear by lulu pants and this is the first time anything like this has happened, but I am still very dissapointed and sad that I can no longer wear my almost brand new leggings.

They definitely hold up to the squat test, and are thick enough to not show underwear. They are probably the most flattering pair of workout pants I have ever owned.

The material holds you in while the seaming creates a slimming effect, and no camel toe ever! They stay in place during intense workouts and the high-rise waist completely eliminates the constant tugging and pulling up (which is so annoying during a workout). I even got my mom and sister hooked!
The only negative is that the threads poke out at the seams almost immediately. I've had to snip the ends of the threads after only one wear. Also, the colors are kind of boring. I'd love to see black with mesh, or two-tone colors like black and grey or navy and grey.",5 out of 5,METHELULUADDICT,,,25-34,SLIM,,,,2016-02-18,7,0,{}
