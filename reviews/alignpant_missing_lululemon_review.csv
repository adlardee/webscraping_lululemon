The thinness of the material is both a blessing and a curse. These pants are ridiculously comfortable and easy to move in but I did notice the material pilling pretty quickly in the thigh area. I don't mind it so much because I bought them to use as leggings I wear under dresses and skirts in colder weather.
However, I saw that one of the seams near the ankle was coming undone and recently noticed it getting worse. After reading the other reviews about this problem I talked to a rep online. They were more than happy to organize a replacement. I ended up just taking them to the store near me, where one of the employees told me to grab a new pair off the shelf (this time an align pant II) and exchanged it for me. I hope this pair will do better than my first but certainly appreciate that I have always been able to resolve issues that occasionally come up with my lulu items without any difficulty.",4 out of 5,SUSANNAZ,PITTSBURGH,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,CURVY,,comfortable,thin material,2016-05-29,2,0,{}

Went to the store, put them on, and instantly fell in love! So in love that I bought them without thinking and then later had to return them after I got my wits about me and realized I couldn't actually afford them at that time haha. After saving up I bought them in a size 4. My measurements are 32-24-38 inches for reference and I'm 5'2, and at first I went by the size chart and tried a size 8. Way too big in the waist, so I sized down to a size 6 which was better but still a bit big and made them sag in the crotch. The size 4 is perfect! Fits my waist snug and is super comfortable on my legs too. I would recommend sizing down if you aren't sure what size to get.
I wear them for lifting, even though I know they aren't for that. Despite using them for the gym (not cardio) they stayed in perfect condition. I put off washing them because I knew they had terrible reviews online about pilling and seams falling apart.
I washed them today in a lingerie bag on delicate by itself in cold water, hung it up to dry, and lo and behold, the seems are fraying pretty badly. It's mostly on one side, and there is also a couple pills there too. Very concerning after dropping more than $100 and this is only after the first wash.
Another thing is, they show sweat despite the ""sweat wicking"". I usually workout in nike dri fit running pants, and they never ever show sweat. Ever. So I was shocked and embarrassed when I found out on leg day that these show sweat. Before I bought them, I talked to a lululemon online chat person and asked them specifically if they showed sweat because I didn't want that, and they said no. They said only if you are sweating excessively will it show. I was not sweating excessively at all when it showed. I called my local store about it and the manager was shocked that someone would tell me that they wouldn't show sweat, and had a bit of an attitude saying that OF COURSE they would show sweat since you're wearing spandex pants (can you hear the implied ""duh""?). So keep that in mind if you want these and don't want sweat to show. I have found that wearing a full underwear and not a thong helps though.
Bottom line: There are no other pants like these that I've tried on, and trust me I've tried soo many looking for any other highwaisted workout pant and none are as comfortable as these. If you have a lot of money where $100 isn't a big deal to you, then go for it and get these. They feel amazing on. But if you're like me and think $100 is a lot of money to spend on leggings, don't buy these. I""m so sad they aren't holding up. At least lululemon does repairs, right?

No pilling.,"I have several pair and I wear them all at least once per week as a barre fitness instructor and gym enthusiast.

My favorite aspect of these pants is that they stay put. I NEVER have to adjust them. I love my Wunder Unders but they require one or two pulls and tugs over the course of wear and I had to stop wearing anything Luxtreme because they just slide right off me. I'm waiting...and hoping that Lulu will release these in a full length 31"" inseam a la Wunder Under, as I am a tall girl.

However, (BIG however) within 2 wears these started to pill. After the first wash, a seam on the inner thigh came loose (I do not wash my leggings more than necessary and pay close attention to proper care so this was not due to improper washing.) 3 months later these leggings look like they are 5 years old and I wore them through a backpacking trip or something; they are SO beat up! I haven't done anything rigorous in them at all either. They are so severely pilled between the legs that they are actually uncomfortable to walk in now because it catches. They are now starting to pill all over as well, including on the butt from sitting/yoga.

I feel like this is just the price you pay for the luxurious feel of the fabric, but its definitely something to consider if you primarily use your pants for high intensity workouts or activities that involve a lot of friction. I would never wear these to CrossFit, because I would be afraid that the barbell would snag on the fabric.
That is not to say that they aren't great for sweaty workouts. I was skeptical about the moisture wicking capacity of the fabric, just because it is SO soft and cloud like, but I wore these to a yoga class that had me perspiring heavily and they really performed well.

I decided to bite the bullet on the full price and bought my first pair as a crop and I was instantly in love. Within 3 weeks, I bought 2 more pairs in the align 7/8 pant. I just bought my 3rd 7/8 align pant in the new navy color and I know I will continue to add on the colors and they come out with new ones. Yes, I went crazy for these pants. Let me tell you why. These pants are soft with that naked sensation that they talk about, it is really true. The high waist does not fold when you are working out, it stays put. These pants are not see-through (which I cannot say for some other Lulu pants on me). They are true to size. You can do almost any athletic exercise in them. They look so good on! They really tighten everything without making you feel like it, so you legs and backside look good.. I honestly LOVE the way they make my backside look more than any other legging. And warning: you will want to wear these every day even when you are not exercising. I went on a vacation that involved a lot of walking/hiking and wore these - even in the heat they feel light and comfortable. I also like wearing them for daily errands. Basically, I blame these pants for making me not want to wear anything else- they are worth it!

I bought them in crops, black and cranberry 7/8 length. They are truly amazing and I love them more than any legging I have ever owned. However, like anything, there are a few issues.
1) The amount of pilling in between the legs is ridiculous. My husband even noticed and commented on how bad it looked. I wash in cold water, inside out, by itself, and hang dry. I even store the legging by themselves to no avail.
2) Maybe it's my ankles but the 7/8 length aren't totally tight around my ankles, they are a little loose and get stretch out around my butt. I find myself pulling them up a lot to make them tight on my butt. They might just be too big but they do tend to stretch.
3) Also, they make me feel slightly held in, but not a lot which is the point of the ""naked"" sensation. However, I would hesitate to buy a light color for fear they wouldn't ""smooth"" everything out.
Overall, I do love them however, I don't think they will stand the test of time. I've only had them about 4 months and the pilling is so bad I am afraid they won't last a year.

She suggested the standard Lulu care regimen- turn inside out, wash with like materials only (no cotton in the load), air dry, etc., in addition to using these pants only for yoga and other low impact activities as suggested in the product details. She also went a step beyond to suggest using a mesh lingerie bag, a trick she uses to get maximum mileage out of her own Lulu gear. Such a great tip!

I wonder do they make it right? Are these customers getting to exchange their pair? If you had Lulu at Nordstrom's I'd buy them because then I could return if I too experience any issues.

But after about 10 wears (and maybe 5-6 washings - delicate cycle cold in the machine and hang dry), they started pilling on the hip/seat area.

When we went to the store to get another pair we tried the Align on and instantly fell in love with them . We both got a pair. It's been 6 months and we are so disappointed. We listened to the sales lady and only wash them alone Never with anything else. The problem is when you wear them they brush against each other from upper thigh to knee between sitting and walking and they have both pilled so bad we only wear them around the house. And we have thin legs! It's also pilling on the front where it might hit your hands or shirt when you sit down. To spend $98 and only wear them around the house because they look old and worn from pilling is crazy! We just had a conversation about them today that prompted this review. We want another pair because they are SO comfortable but won't spend $98x2 on pants that you can only wear a couple times before they start looking bad. I hope they improve these and keep the texture because I got so many compliments on them and even a comment about the piling!!

The 3 pairs I bought soon replaced my jeans as my everyday wear and I have received innumerable complements since purchasing them. They are versatile and surprisingly elegant for sportswear. I have worn them everyday all day for the past 4 months, washing each on average once per weak on the most delicate ""hand-wash"" cycle, inside out, then hung to dry. Sadly, as other customers have pointed out, after a few months, they started to pile. The piling on the legs is very slight but it is considerable at the crotch, which makes me think that it is much more a question of friction than upkeep. I used a good-quality sweater shaver on the affected area, which removed the bulk of the piling so that they remain wearable. Nevertheless, despite my best efforts and care, I doubt they will last me more than a year. Suffice to say that the product is a huge disappointment. As a customer, I carefully select and invest in the clothes that I buy to make sure that I can wear them for years and reduce my waste. I have purchased numerous Lululemon products in the past that have stood the test of time: from yoga pants to tops to hoodies. I have never had a problem. And I trusted that these pants would be no different - hence my investment in 3 pairs! I can't say it's money down the drain. They are amazing while they last. But I just can't get behind a product that I have to throw out after a year or less. It weighs on my conscience and purse strings. I hope Lululemon can sort it out for future products because I'd love to find a similar pant without the same problem.",2 out of 5,NINI343,"MONTREAL, QC, CANADA",SWEATY GENERALIST,35-44,CURVY,,fit,piling,2016-11-24,4,1,"{'LL_response_content': ""Hi there Nini343,\nThank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

Incredibly soft. Amazingly comfortable. Opaque enough to wear in public without worrying about booty exposure. Smoothed down my (many) imperfections and made me feel awesome and confident. I bought three pairs! I could even wear them to work without feeling out of place.
But the pilling. Oh god, the pilling. It's truly the worst amount of pilling I've ever experienced with any type of clothing. Every single pair had a massive amount - not just in the thighs, but on the backs of the legs, on the butt, even on the bottom. It was a nightmare, but I still loved my pants and I thought I could get through it.
Now two of the three pairs have started to develop these odd ""wear"" lines that almost feel like small divots along the fabric. I have taken great care of these - cold wash, low tumble dry, always with delicates. Now I have these tiger stripe lines where the fabric is thin enough to kind of see through. So for this to be happening out of what feels like nowhere, after not all that long, is tough to stomach. I spent $300 on these three pairs and only one still feels 100% wearable.

However, I have had these pants for 5 months now and they still look and feel brand new. Almost no pilling anywhere and they still fit like a glove. PEOPLE DO NOT PUT THEM IN THE WASH. hand wash them. with detergent. in the sink. hang to dry. I wear these like twice a week and are still in perfect condition. they even held up better than my wonder unders which have so much pilling that i bought a month ago...
anyways, BUY THEM they are amazing but take care of them...lulu is an investment",5 out of 5,COLLEGEGIRL96,"RICHMOND, VA, USA",SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,SLIM,,,,2016-11-29,3,0,{}

We took the care advice / instructions from the sales person at the store and have washed them inside out and they have held up pretty well over the last few months, but I will admit that for those of us wearing the size 12, the thighs do rub together and there is a substantial amount of pilling going on there. :( Sadly I now have some really pricy leggings that I feel can only be worn around the house.
