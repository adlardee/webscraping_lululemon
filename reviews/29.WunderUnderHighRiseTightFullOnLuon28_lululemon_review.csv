I love the inside pocket to hold my ID and/or credit card and keys if need be. It might even hold my phone as well for runs, but I haven't tried it yet.

They look great with other neutrals -- think white, gray, black, blues of any hue, possibly even that dusty rose color, too.
And now, the bad news and why I gave it one star - I slide when I do arm balances in hot yoga! Granted, I should use my core more in crow pose to keep myself stable (I hear you, yogi veterans, namaste), but it would help if they provided my sweaty arms a little grip to help me get there.

This was really confusing to me since they feel SO tight. I thought maybe they would stretch out but they have not. I dread putting them on because it's a chore to get them on/off and go to the bathroom! I have to roll them down if I'm sitting for a while because my guts seriously feel like they're being strangled. I wore them on a long plane ride which was a HUGE mistake! Normally leggings are my go to for comfort but now I'm wearing these only because I paid nearly $100 for them and feel like I have to.
full disclosure, I have bought a 2 in some of the other styles and they have worked out fine but those have a LOT more give than these.
