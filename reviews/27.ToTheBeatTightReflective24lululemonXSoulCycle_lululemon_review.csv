I'm assuming the price is so high because of the SoulCycle affiliations, but I'm not sure they're worth it. I struggled with whether or not I would recommend. They feel amazing and I love the high rise but the reflective details do not reflect! I also could have gone down a size. So this review was a real struggle.

The reflective details on the adobe dust are rose pink-love! I think that the length is perfect for all activities. I can't imagine any activity these wouldn't work for to be honest. The fit and feel of these is amazing. Between the fit, feel, function, details, and I think the quality and stitching seem top-notch, I'd say they're worth every money as I'll probably get years out of them with proper care and washing.
As for fit, I am in between size 2 & 4. The 4 feels a bit loose especially in the legs, whereas the 2 is a tad tight in the waist (but not uncomfortably so). Both feel comfortable. Neither size is see-through. I may keep a 4 in one color and a 2 in the other-I'm that split between sizing.",5 out of 5,PEANUT2017,"SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA",SWEATY GENERALIST,I KEEP MY AGE ON THE D.L.,LEAN,,pattern lots of reflectivity the reflective patt,,2019-01-28,7,0,{}
