Even though I own at least 15 items from the brand, I have never had an issue with any of them
However, I'm really disappointed in these pants - I was so excited because they are so light, stretchy and even advertise that they are high-waisted, so I was expecting another Align type pant (I have two pairs of Align pants and they are my go-to!) but these are definitely NOT high-waisted. I wore them to one barre class and they would not stay up past my belly button (my Aligns and In Movement tights have never had this issue, and I always wear a size 4).
To make matters worse, I wore them to a yoga class and have already noticed a rip in the inseam.
Super disappointed because I want to love these pants, but especially since these are a higher price point than other lulu pants, I wish I had just spent my money on another pair of Aligns :(",2 out of 5,AB12345,"TORONTO, ON",SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,PETITE,,light fabric,not a true high waist,2019-01-20,2,1,{}

I did not purchase for a few reasons. First, the rise was much lower than expected, mid-rise at the highest. My hips / butt are wider due to heavy squats and deadlifts, so the mid-rise fit cuts me off weirdly. Second, the inseam was longer than I'm used to. The typical 7/8 pant is perfect for me, and these were just a little too long at 26"" instead of 25"". Finally, when in the deepest depths of a good morning position, I could see my underwear.
